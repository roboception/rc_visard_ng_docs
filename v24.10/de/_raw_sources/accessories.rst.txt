|company| offers an optional connectivity kit to aid customers with setting up the |rc_xxx|. 
For permanent installation, the customer is responsible for providing a suitable power supply.
The connectivity kit consists of a:

- network cable with straight M12 plug to straight RJ45 connector in either 2 m, 5 m, or 10 m length,
- power adapter cable with straight M12 socket to DC barrel connector in 30 cm length,
- 24 V, 30 W wall power supply, or a 24 V, 60 W desktop power supply.

Connecting the |rc_xxx| to residential or office grid power requires a power supply that 
meets EN 55011 Class B emission standards. The E2CFS 30W 24V by EGSTON System Electronics 
Eggenburg GmbH (http://www.egston.com) contained in the connectivity kit is certified 
accordingly. However, it does not meet immunity standards for industrial environments 
under EN 61000-6-2.

Power supplies
""""""""""""""

.. index::
   single: power supply

The |rc_xxx| is classified as an EN-55011 Class B device and immune to light 
industrial and industrial environments. For connecting the sensor to residential 
grid power, a power supply under EN 55011/55022 Class B has to be used.

It is the customer's responsibility to obtain and install a suitable power supply 
satisfying EN 61000-6-2 for permanent installation in industrial environments. One 
example that satisfies both EN 61000-6-2 and EN 55011/55022 Class B is the DIN-Rail
mounted PULS MiniLine ML60.241 24V/DC 2.5 A by PULS GmbH (http://www.pulspower.com). 
A certified electrician must perform installation.

Only one |rc_xxx| shall be connected to a power supply at any time, and the total 
length of cables must be less than 30 m.
