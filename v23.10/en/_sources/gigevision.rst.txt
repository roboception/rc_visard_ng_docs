GigE Vision 2.0/GenICam image interface

Gigabit Ethernet for Machine Vision ("GigE Vision®" for short) is an
industrial camera interface standard based on UDP/IP (see

http://www.gigevision.com

). The

rc_visard NG

 is a GigE Vision® version 2.0 device and is hence compatible with all
GigE Vision® 2.0 compliant frameworks and libraries.

GigE Vision® uses GenICam to describe the camera/device features. For
more information about this

Generic Interface for Cameras

 see

http://www.genicam.org/

.

Via this interface the

rc_visard NG

 provides features such as

discovery,

IP configuration,

configuration of camera related parameters,

image grabbing, and

time synchronization via IEEE 1588-2008 PrecisionTimeProtocol (PTPv2).

Note: The

  rc_visard NG

   supports jumbo frames of up to 9000 bytes. Setting an MTU of 9000
  on your GigE Vision client side is recommended for best performance.

Note: Roboception provides tools and a C++ API with examples for
  discovery, configuration, and image streaming via the GigE
  Vision/GenICam interface. See

  http://www.roboception.com/download

  .

GigE Vision ports

GigE Vision is a UDP based protocol. On the

rc_visard NG

 the UDP ports are fixed and known:

UDP port 3956: GigE Vision Control Protocol (GVCP). Used for
discovery, control and configuration.

UDP port 50010: Stream channel source port for GigE Vision Stream
Protocol (GVSP) used for image streaming.

Important GenICam parameters

The following list gives an overview of the relevant GenICam features
of the

rc_visard NG

 that can be read and/or changed via the GenICam interface. In
addition to the standard parameters, which are defined in the Standard
Feature Naming Convention (SFNC, see

http://www.emva.org/standards-technology/genicam/genicam-downloads/

),

rc_visard NG

 devices also offer custom parameters that account for special
features of the

Camera

 and the

Stereo matching

 module.

   then only camera images are delivered that are captured while the
   output is high, i.e. a potentially connected projector is on (or

   Scan3dBaseline should be used instead.

Category: DepthControl

"DepthAcquisitionMode"
   type: Enumeration, one of SingleFrame, SingleFrameOut1 or
   Continuous

   default: Continuous

   description: In single frame mode, stereo matching is performed
   upon each call of DepthAcquisitionTrigger. The SingleFrameOut1 mode
   can be used to control an external projector. It sets the line
   source of Out1 to ExposureAlternateActive upon each trigger and
   resets it to Low as soon as the images for stereo matching are
   grabbed. In continuous mode, stereo matching is performed
   continuously.

"DepthAcquisitionTrigger"
   type: Command

   description: This command triggers stereo matching of the next
   available stereo image pair, if DepthAcquisitionMode is set to
   SingleFrame or SingleFrameOut1.

   filtering\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:expl-depth-max-depth-
   err}).

Chunk data

The

rc_visard NG

 supports chunk parameters that are transmitted with every image.
Chunk parameters all have the prefix "Chunk". Their meaning equals
their non-chunk counterparts, except that they belong to the
corresponding image, e.g. "Scan3dFocalLength" depends on
"ComponentSelector" and "DepthQuality" as both can change the image
resolution. The parameter "ChunkScan3dFocalLength" that is delivered
with an image fits to the resolution of the corresponding image.

Particularly useful chunk parameters are:

ChunkComponentSelector selects for which component to extract the
chunk data in MultiPart mode.

ChunkComponentID and ChunkComponentIDValue provide the relation of the
image to its component (e.g. camera image or disparity image) without
guessing from the image format or size.

ChunkLineStatusAll provides the status of all GPIOs at the time of
image acquisition. See LineStatusAll above for a description of bits.

ChunkScan3d... parameters are useful for 3D reconstruction as
described in Section Image stream conversions\:(Section
\ref{gigevision:sect-image-stream-conversions}).

ChunkPartIndex provides the index of the image part in this MultiPart
block for the selected component (ChunkComponentSelector).

ChunkRcOut1Reduction gives a ratio of how much the brightness of the
images with GPIO Out1 LOW is lower than the brightness of the images
with GPIO Out1 HIGH. For example, a value of 0.2 means that the images
with GPIO Out1 LOW have 20% less brightness than the images with GPIO
Out1 HIGH. This value is only available if exp_auto_mode of the stereo
camera is set to AdaptiveOut1 or Out1High (auto exposure mode, Section
\ref{stereo_camera:expl-exp-auto-mode}).

Chunk data is enabled by setting the GenICam parameter
"ChunkModeActive" to "True".

Provided image streams

The

rc_visard NG

 provides the following five different image streams via the GenICam
interface:

      Component name  PixelFormat  Description  Intensity  Mono8
(monochrome cameras)  YCbCr411_8 (color cameras)  Left rectified
camera image  IntensityCombined  Mono8 (monochrome cameras)
YCbCr411_8 (color cameras)  Left rectified camera image stacked on
right rectified camera image  Disparity  Coord3D_C16  Disparity image
in desired resolution, i.e., DepthQuality of Full, High, Medium or Low
Confidence  Confidence8  Confidence image  Error  Error8 (custom:
0x81080001)  Disparity error image

Each image comes with a buffer timestamp and the

PixelFormat

 given in the above table. This PixelFormat should be used to
distinguish between the different image types. Images belonging to the
same acquisition timestamp can be found by comparing the GenICam
buffer timestamps.

Image stream conversions

The disparity image contains 16 bit unsigned integer values. These
values must be multiplied by the scale value given in the GenICam
feature

Scan3dCoordinateScale

 to get the disparity values d in pixels. To compute the 3D object
coordinates from the disparity values, the focal length and the
baseline as well as the principle point are required. These parameters
are transmitted as GenICam features

Scan3dFocalLength

,

Scan3dBaseline

,

Scan3dPrincipalPointU

 and

Scan3dPrincipalPointV

. The focal length and principal point depend on the image resolution
of the selected component. Knowing these values, the pixel coordinates
and the disparities can be transformed into 3D object coordinates in
the camera coordinate frame using the equations described in

Computing depth images and point clouds

.

Note: The

  rc_visard NG

  's camera coordinate frame is defined as shown in

  sensor coordinate frame

  .

Assuming that d16_{ik} is the 16 bit disparity value at column i and
row k of a disparity image, the float disparity in pixels d_{ik} is
given by

   d_{ik}=d16_{ik} \cdot \mathrm{Scan3dCoordinateScale}

The 3D reconstruction in meters can be written with the GenICam
parameters as:

   P_x&=\left(i+0.5-\mathrm{Scan3dPrincipalPointU}\right)
   \frac{\mathrm{Scan3dBaseline}}{d_{ik}},\\
   P_y&=\left(k+0.5-\mathrm{Scan3dPrincipalPointV}\right)
   \frac{\mathrm{Scan3dBaseline}}{d_{ik}},\\
   P_z&=\mathrm{Scan3dFocalLength}
   \frac{\mathrm{Scan3dBaseline}}{d_{ik}}.

The confidence image contains 8 bit unsigned integer values. These
values have to be divided by 255 to get the confidence as value
between 0 an 1.

The error image contains 8 bit unsigned integer values. The error
e_{ik} must be multiplied by the scale value given in the GenICam
feature

Scan3dCoordinateScale

 to get the disparity-error values d_{eps} in pixels. According to the
description in

Confidence and error images

, the depth error z_{eps} in meters can be computed with GenICam
parameters as

   d_{ik}&=d16_{ik} \cdot \mathrm{Scan3dCoordinateScale},\\
   z_{eps}&=\frac{e_{ik} \cdot \mathrm{Scan3dCoordinateScale} \cdot
   \mathrm{Scan3dFocalLength}               \cdot
   \mathrm{Scan3dBaseline}}              {(d_{ik})^2}.

Note: It is preferable to enable chunk data with the parameter

  ChunkModeActive

   and to use the chunk parameters

  ChunkScan3dCoordinateScale

  ,

  ChunkScan3dFocalLength

  ,

  ChunkScan3dBaseline

  ,

  ChunkScan3dPrincipalPointU

   and

  ChunkScan3dPrincipalPointV

   that are delivered with every image, because their values already
  fit to the image resolution of the corresponding image.

please refer to
