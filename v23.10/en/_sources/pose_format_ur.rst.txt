Universal Robots pose format

The pose format that is used by Universal Robots consists of a
position XYZ in millimeters and an orientation in angle-axis format
V=(\begin{array}{ccc}RX & RY & RZ\end{array})^T. The rotation angle
\theta in radians is the length of the rotation axis U.

   V = \left(\begin{array}{c}RX \\ RY \\ RZ\end{array}\right) =
   \left(\begin{array}{c}\theta u_x \\ \theta u_y \\ \theta
   u_z\end{array}\right)

V is called a rotation vector.

Conversion from angle-axis format to quaternion

The conversion from a rotation vector V to a quaternion
q=(\begin{array}{cccc}x & y & z & w\end{array}) can be done as
follows.

We first recover the angle \theta in radians from the rotation vector
V by

   \theta = \sqrt{RX^2 + RY^2 + RZ^2}\text{.}

If \theta = 0, then the quaternion is q=(\begin{array}{cccc}0 & 0 & 0
& 1\end{array}), otherwise it is

   x = RX \frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\theta}\text{,} \\ y = RY
   \frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\theta}\text{,} \\ z = RZ
   \frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\theta}\text{,} \\ w = \cos(\theta/2)\text{.}

Conversion from quaternion to angle-axis format

The conversion from a quaternion q=(\begin{array}{cccc}x & y & z &
w\end{array}) with ||q||=1 to a rotation vector in angle-axis form can
be done as follows.

We first recover the angle \theta in radians from the quaternion by

   \theta = 2\cdot\text{acos}(w)\text{.}

If \theta = 0, then the rotation vector is V=(\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 0
& 0\end{array})^T, otherwise it is

   RX = \theta \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-w^2}}\text{,} \\ RY = \theta
   \frac{y}{\sqrt{1-w^2}}\text{,} \\ RZ = \theta
   \frac{z}{\sqrt{1-w^2}}\text{.}
