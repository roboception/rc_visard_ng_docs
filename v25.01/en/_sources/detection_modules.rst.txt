Detection & Measure modules

The

rc_visard NG

 offers software modules for different detection and measuring
applications:

Measure (rc_measure, Section \ref{measure:sect-measure})  provides
measure functionalities, such as depth measurements.

LoadCarrier (rc_load_carrier, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-
loadcarrier})  allows detecting load carriers and their filling
levels.

TagDetect (rc_april_tag_detect and rc_qr_code_detect, Section
\ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection})  allows the detection of AprilTags
and QR codes, as well as the estimation of their poses.

ItemPick (rc_itempick, Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick})  provides
an out-of-the-box perception solution for robotic pick-and-place
applications of  unknown objects.

BoxPick (rc_boxpick, Section \ref{boxpick:sect-boxpick})  provides an
out-of-the-box perception solution for robotic pick-and-place
applications of boxes or textured boxes.

SilhouetteMatch (rc_silhouettematch, Section \ref{silhouettematch
:sect-silhouettematch})  provides an object detection solution for
objects placed on a plane or stacked planar objects.

CADMatch (rc_cadmatch, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch})  provides
an object detection solution for 3D objects.

These modules are optional and can be activated by purchasing a
separate

license
