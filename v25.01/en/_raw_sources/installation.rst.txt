Installation
============

.. index::
   single: installation

.. Warning:: The instructions on :ref:`sect-safety`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{safety:sect-safety})` related to the |rc_xxx| must be read and understood prior to installation.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

   The |rc_xxx| offers a Gigabit Ethernet interface for connecting the device to a computer
   network. All communications to and from the device are performed via this interface. The
   |rc_xxx| has an on-board computing resource that requires booting time after powering
   up the device.

.. only:: rc_cube

   The |rc_cube| offers multiple Gigabit Ethernet interfaces:

   * One interface labeled "external" for connecting the device to a local computer network, and
   * up to four interfaces labeled "sensor<N>" for connecting one or more 3D cameras such as the
     |rc_visard| or |rc_viscore| :mvexclude:`or Basler blaze` sensor
     (see :ref:`sect-camera-connection`:latex:`, Section \ref{installation:sect-camera-connection}`).

   All other Ethernet ports are disabled.

   For commissioning, operation, or troubleshooting the user can connect input devices
   such as a mouse and a keyboard as well as a computer screen directly to the |rc_xxx|.
   However, this is optional as the functionality of the |rc_cube| is fully accessible
   via the local network it is connected to.

   .. note:: If a screen is used on the |rc_cube|, it must be connected before booting,
            or the |rc_cube| must be restarted to activate the screen.

Software license
----------------

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    Every |rc_xxx| device ships with a pre-installed license file for licensing
    and protection of the installed software packages. The license
    is bound to that specific |rc_xxx| device and cannot be used or
    transferred to other devices.

.. only:: rc_cube

    Every |rc_xxx| device ships with a USB dongle for licensing
    and protection of the installed software packages. The purchased
    software licenses are installed on and are bound to this dongle and
    its ID.

The functionality of the |rc_xxx| can
be enhanced anytime by
:ref:`upgrading the license<sect-updating-license>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})`,
e.g., for optionally available software modules.

.. note:: The |rc_xxx| requires to be rebooted whenever the installed
          licenses have changed.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    .. note:: The license status can be retrieved
              via the |rc_xxx|'s various interfaces
              such as the :menuselection:`System --> Firmware & License` page of the
              :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.

.. only:: rc_cube

    .. note:: The dongle ID and the license status can be retrieved
              via the |rc_xxx|'s various interfaces
              such as the :menuselection:`System --> Firmware & License` page of the
              :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.

    .. note:: For the software components to be properly licensed, the USB dongle
              must be plugged to the |rc_xxx| **before power up**.

    .. note:: The |rc_xxx| requires to be rebooted, whenever the license
              dongle is plugged to or unplugged from the device.

Power up
--------

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    .. index::
      single: LED

    .. Note:: Always fully connect and tighten the M12 power connector on the |rc_xxx|
      *before* turning on the power supply.

    After connecting the |rc_xxx| to the power, the LED on the front of the device should
    immediately illuminate. During the device's boot process, the LED will change
    color and will eventually turn green. This signals that all processes are up and
    running.

    If the network is not plugged in or the network is not properly configured, then the LED
    will flash red every 5 seconds. In this case, the device's network configuration
    should be verified. See :ref:`sect-led-colors`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{troubleshooting:sect-led-colors})`
    for more information on the LED color codes.

.. only:: rc_cube

    .. note:: The *rc_cube I* does not come with a power supply. A separate 24V/20Amp (e.g. top hat rail) power supply is required.

    The |rc_xxx| is booted by using the power switch on the device.
    If a computer screen is connected it will display the |rc_xxx|'s
    |webgui| when the boot process is finished.

    .. Note:: For successful operation please make sure that the |rcvisard| being
       connected to the |rc_xxx| is powered and booted.

.. _sect-discovery-of-rcvisard-devices:

Discovery of |rc_xxx| devices
-------------------------------

.. index::
   single: discovery GUI
   single: reset

|company| |rc_xxx| devices that are powered up and connected to the local network or directly to a
computer can be found using the standard GigE Vision\ |reg| discovery mechanism.

.. only:: basler

   |manufacturer| offers the open-source tool ``rcdiscover-gui``, which is available for Windows and Linux.
   The tool's Windows version consists of a single executable for Windows 7, 10 and 11, which can be executed without installation.
   For Linux an installation package is available for Ubuntu.

.. only:: roboception or matrixvision

   |manufacturer| offers the open-source tool ``rcdiscover-gui``, which can be downloaded free of charge from
   https://github.com/roboception/rcdiscover/releases for Windows and Linux.
   The tool's Windows version consists of a single executable for Windows 7, 10 and 11, which can be executed without installation.
   For Linux an installation package is available for Ubuntu.

   The tool's Windows version consists of a single executable for Windows 7, 10 and 11, which can be executed without installation.
   For Linux an installation package is available for Ubuntu.


At startup, all available GigE Vision\ |reg| devices -- including |rc_xxx| devices -- are
listed with their names, serial numbers, current IP addresses, and unique MAC addresses. The
discovery tool finds all devices reachable by global broadcasts. Misconfigured devices
that are located in different subnets than the application host may also be listed. A tickmark in the
discovery tool indicates whether devices are actually reachable via a
web browser.

After successful discovery, a double click on the device row opens the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\ (Section
\ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})` of the device in the operating system's default web browser.
Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are recommended as web browser.

Resetting configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. only:: rc_cube

    .. Note:: The ``rcdiscover-gui`` resetting mechanism is currently not implemented for |rc_cube| devices.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    A misconfigured device can be reset by using the *Reset rc_visard* button in the
    discovery tool. The reset mechanism is only available for two minutes
    after device startup. Thus, the |rc_xxx| may require rebooting before
    being able to reset the device.

    .. figure:: images/rcdiscover_reset.png
      :width: 50 %
      :align: center

      Reset dialog of the ``rcdiscover-gui`` tool

    If the discovery tool still successfully detects the the misconfigured |rc_xxx|,
    then the latter can be selected from the *rc-visard* drop-down menu. Otherwise,
    the |rc_xxx|'s MAC address, which is printed on the device label, can be entered
    manually into the designated fields.

    One of four options can be chosen after entering the MAC address:

    - *Reset Parameters*: Reset all |rc_xxx| parameters, such as frame rate, that are configurable via
      :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.
    - *Reset Network*: Reset network settings and user-defined name.
    - *Reset All*: Reset the |rc_xxx| parameters as well as network settings and user-defined name.
    - *Switch Partitions*: Allows a rollback to be performed as described in
      :ref:`sect-restoring-the-previous-firmware-version`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-restoring-the-previous-firmware-version})`.

    A white status LED followed by a device reboot indicates a successful reset.
    If no reaction is noticeable, the two minutes time slot may have elapsed, requiring
    another reboot.

    .. Note:: The reset mechanism is only available for the first two minutes after startup.

.. _sect-network-configuration:

Network configuration
---------------------

.. index::
   single: network configuration
   single: IP address

The |rc_xxx| requires an Internet Protocol (:term:`IP`) address for communication with other network
devices. The IP address must be unique in the local network, and can be set either manually via a
user-configurable persistent IP address, or automatically via :term:`DHCP`.
If none of these IP configuration methods apply, the |rc_xxx| falls back to a :term:`Link-Local` IP address.

.. only:: rc_cube

    The network settings of the |rc_visard| that is used in combination with the |rc_xxx|
    are automatically configured when the |rc_visard| is connected to the |rc_xxx|.

    .. note:: To not conflict with the internal network between the |rc_xxx| and
              the connected |rc_visard|, the IP address assigned to the |rc_xxx| in the
              local network must not be in the range of ``172.23.42.0/24`` and ``172.17.0.0/16``.

Following the :term:`GigE Vision`\ |reg| standard, the priority of IP configuration methods on the |rc_xxx| is

    1. Persistent IP (if enabled)
    2. DHCP (if enabled)
    3. Link-Local

   :align: center

   |rc_xxx|'s IP configuration method selection flowchart

Options for changing the |rc_xxx|'s network settings and IP configuration are:

    * the :menuselection:`System --> Network` page of the |rc_xxx|'s |webgui| -- if it is reachable in the local network already,
      see :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
    * any configuration tool compatible with :term:`GigE Vision`\ |reg| 2.0,
      or |manufacturer|'s command-line tool ``gc_config``. Typically, these tools scan for all available GigE Vision\ |reg|
      devices on the network. All |rc_xxx| devices can be uniquely identified by their serial number and MAC address,
      which are both printed on the device.
    * temporarily changing or completely resetting the |rc_xxx|'s network configuration via |manufacturer|'s
      ``rcdiscover-gui`` tool, see :ref:`sect-discovery-of-rcvisard-devices`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-discovery-of-rcvisard-devices})`

.. only:: roboception or schunk or matrixvision

   .. note:: The command-line tool ``gc_config`` is part of |manufacturer|'s open-source convenience layer ``rc_genicam_api``,
             which can be downloaded free of charge for Windows and Linux from http://www.roboception.com/download.

.. _sect-network-hostname:

Host name
^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: host name
   single: serial number

.. only:: rc_visard

       The |rc_xxx|'s host name is based on its serial number, which is printed on the device, and
       is defined as ``rc-visard-<serial number>``.

.. only:: rc_visard_ng

       The |rc_xxx|'s host name is based on its serial number, which is printed on the device, and
       is defined as ``rc-visard-ng-<serial number>``.

.. only:: rc_cube

       The |rc_xxx|'s host name is based on its serial number, which is printed on the device, and
       is defined as ``rc-cube-<serial number>``.

.. _sect-auto-network-configuration:

Automatic configuration (factory default)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: DHCP
   single: host name
   single: MAC address

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (:term:`DHCP`) is preferred for setting an IP
address. If DHCP is active on the |rc_xxx|, which is the factory default, the
device tries to contact a DHCP server at startup and every time the network cable is being
plugged in. If a DHCP server is available on the network, the IP address
is automatically configured.

In some networks, the DHCP server is configured so that it only accepts known
devices. In this case, the Media Access Control address (:term:`MAC address`), which is printed on
the device label, needs to be configured in the DHCP server. At the same time, the |rc_xxx|'s host
name can also be set in the Domain Name Server (:term:`DNS`). Both MAC address and host name should
be sent to the network administrator for configuration.

.. index::
   single: Link-Local

If the |rc_xxx| cannot contact a DHCP server within about 15 seconds after startup, or
after plugging in the network cable, it assigns itself a unique
IP address. This process is called :term:`Link-Local`. This option is especially useful for
connecting the |rc_xxx| directly to a computer. The computer must be configured for Link-Local
as well. Link-Local might already be configured as a standard fallback option,
as it is under Windows 10. Other operating systems such as Linux require Link-Local
to be explicitly configured in their network managers.

.. _sect-manual-network-configuration:

Manual configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   pair: Baumer; IpConfigTool
   pair: GigE Vision; IP address

Specifying a persistent, i.e. static IP address manually might be useful in some cases.
This address is stored on the |rc_xxx| to be used on device startup or network reconnection.
Please make sure the selected IP address, subnet mask and gateway will not cause any
conflicts on the network.

.. Warning:: The IP address must be unique within the local network and within the local network's range of valid addresses.
             Furthermore, the subnet mask must match the local network; otherwise, the |rcxxx|
             may become inaccessible. This can be avoided by using
             automatic configuration as explained in :ref:`sect-auto-network-configuration`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{installation:sect-auto-network-configuration})`.

If this IP address cannot be assigned, e.g. because it is already used by another device in the network,
IP configuration will fall back to automatic configuration via :term:`DHCP` (if enabled) or a :term:`Link-Local` address.

.. only:: rc_cube

   .. _sect-camera-connection:

   Connection of cameras
   ---------------------

   .. index::
      pair: camera connection; installation

   Depending on the |rc_cube| model, two or more 3D cameras can be connected
   to the Ethernet ports labelled *sensor0*, *sensor1*, etc.

   The *rc_cube S* has one 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port for connecting up to two sensors, e.g.

   .. only:: matrixvision

      * connecting one |rc_visard| without additional hardware
      * connecting two |rc_visard| devices via a separate 2.5Gbit switch
      * connecting one |rc_viscore| via a separate 2.5Gbit switch

   .. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

      * connecting one |rc_visard| without additional hardware
      * connecting two |rc_visard| devices via a separate 2.5Gbit switch
      * connecting one |rc_viscore| via a separate 2.5Gbit switch
      * connecting one |blaze| via a separate 2.5Gbit switch

   The *rc_cube I* has four 1 Gigabit Ethernet ports for connecting up to four sensors, e.g.

   .. only:: matrixvision

      * connecting up to four |rc_visard| devices without additional hardware
      * connecting up to two |rc_viscore| devices without additional hardware

   .. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

      * connecting up to four |rc_visard| devices without additional hardware
      * connecting up to two |rc_viscore| devices without additional hardware
      * connecting up to two |blaze| sensors devices without additional hardware

   It is also possible to connect 3D cameras of different types to an |rc_cube|, if the
   number of Ethernet ports permits. However, the
   *rc_cube S* cannot process more than two sensors at the same time, the *rc_cube I* not
   more than four.

   .. Warning:: The |rc_viscore| :mvexclude:`or Basler blaze` sensor must not be connected via a 1Gbit switch or slower, as this
               leads to severe loss of images.

   The |rc_cube| offers up to four software *camera pipelines* for processing data from the connected sensors.
   The configuration of the camera pipelines is explained in :doc:`pipelines`:latex:`\:(see Section \ref{pipelines:sect-pipelines})`.

   .. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

      .. _sect-blaze-installation:

      Basler blaze sensors
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. index::
         pair: blaze; installation
         pair: blaze; calibration

      After connecting the Basler blaze sensor, it can take up to about one minute until it is found. Upon first
      connection of the sensor to the |rc_cube|, the sensor must be calibrated before it can be used.
      Calibration can be done through the |webgui| on the page :ref:`sect-camera-calibration`:latex:`\:(Section
      \ref{camera_calibration:sect-camera-calibration})` under *Configuration* in the respective pipeline.
      After storing the calibration, it will persistently reside on the |rc_cube| and automatically be
      used whenever the sensor is connected to the |rc_cube| again, regardless of the port or pipeline.
