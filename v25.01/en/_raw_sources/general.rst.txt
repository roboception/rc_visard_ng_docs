Overview
========

.. only:: rc_cube


    The |rc_xxx| is a high-performance 3D-image-processing device. 
    It enhances the computing capabilities of the |company| stereo camera |rc_visard| and
    supports :mvexclude:`the Basler blaze camera in an RGB-D setup and` the |rc_viscore|.

    .. NOTE:: Unless specified, the information provided in this manual applies to both the |rc_visard| 65 and |rc_visard| 160 
        versions of the |company| |rc_visard| sensor, as well as the |rc_visard_ng|.

    .. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

        .. NOTE:: The term "blaze" used throughout the manual always refers to the Basler blaze camera in an RGB-D setup, i.e. the blaze
            Time-of-Flight camera in combination with the Basler aceA1300 color camera.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    The 3D sensor |rc_xxx| is an IP54-protected :visardonly:`, self-registering` stereo-camera
    with on-board computing capabilities.

The |rc_xxx| provides real-time camera images and depth images, which can
be used to compute 3D point clouds. Additionally, it provides
confidence and error images as quality measures for each image acquisition.
It offers an intuitive web UI (user interface) and a standardized
GenICam interface, making it compatible with all major image processing
libraries.

With optionally available software modules the |rc_xxx| provides out-of-the-box solutions
for object detection and robotic pick-and-place applications.

.. only:: rc_cube

    The |rc_cube| is offered in two versions: *rc_cube S* and *rc_cube I*.

    The *rc_cube S* is suitable for research, development and testing environments. It supports one |rc_visard| without additional hardware. 
    A separate 2.5Gbit switch (not part of the product scope) enables the support of two |rc_visard| devices at a time or allows to connect
    an |rc_viscore| :mvexclude:`or a Basler blaze` device.

    The *rc_cube I* is intended for operational use in an industrial environment. It supports four |rc_visard| cameras, or two |rc_viscore| 
    :mvexclude:`or Basler blaze` devices without additional hardware.

.. only:: rc_visard

    The |rc_visard| also provides self-localization based on image and inertial data.
    A mobile navigation solution can be established with the optional on-board SLAM module.

    The |rc_visard| is offered with two different stereo baselines: The |rc_visard| 65
    is optimally suited for mounting on robotic manipulators, whereas the |rc_visard| 160 can be 
    employed as a navigation or as externally-fixed sensor.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    The |rc_xxx|'s intuitive calibration, configuration, and use enable 3D vision for everyone.
