3D camera modules
=================

The |rc_xxx|'s 3D camera software consists of the following modules:

- :doc:`stereo_camera` (``rc_camera``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera}`)
   acquires image pairs and performs planar rectification for using the
   camera as a measurement device.
   Images are provided both for further internal processing by other modules
   and for external use as :ref:`GenICam image streams <sect-genicam>`.

.. only:: rc_cube

   - :doc:`stereo_matching` (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)
      uses the rectified stereo image pairs of the connected stereo camera, e.g. the |rc_visard|, to compute 3D depth
      information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
      These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

   - :doc:`stereo_matching` (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)
      uses the rectified stereo image pairs to compute 3D depth
      information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
      These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or schunk or basler)

   - :doc:`blaze` (``rc_blaze``:latex:`, Section \ref{blaze:sect-blaze}`)
      provides 3D depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images of the connected
      Basler blaze RGB-D camera.
      These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

.. only:: rc_cube

   These modules are pipeline specific, which means that they run inside each
   camera pipeline. Changes to their settings or parameters
   only affect the corresponding pipeline and have no influence on the other
   camera pipelines running on the |rc_cube|.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or schunk or basler)

   .. note:: 
      The Stereo Matching module is only available in camera pipelines of type ``rc_visard`` or ``rc_viscore``.
      The Blaze module is only available in camera pipelines of type ``blaze``.

The :doc:`stereo_camera` and the :doc:`stereo_matching` modules, which
acquire image pairs and compute 3D depth information such as disparity,
error, and confidence images, are also accessible via the |rc_xxx|'s
:doc:`GigE Vision/GenICam interface<gigevision>`.
