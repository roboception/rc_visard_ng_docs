      DHCP
         The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to automatically assign an
         :term:`IP` address to a network device. Some DHCP servers only accept known devices.
         In this case, an administrator needs to configure the DHCP server with the
         fixed :term:`MAC address` of a device.

      .. disparity
      .. disparity image
      ..   Disparity is the displacement of the projections of an object point in two camera
      ..   images. If the images are :term:`rectified`, then the disparity is the difference
      ..   between the column index of the projection in the left image and the column index
      ..   of the projection in the right image. The disparity is inversely proportional to
      ..   the distance (i.e., depth)
      ..   of the object point from the camera and becomes 0 if the object point is at infinity.
      ..   A disparity image contains disparities for each pixel.

      DNS
      mDNS
         The Domain Name Server (DNS) manages the host names and :term:`IP` addresses of all
         network devices. It is responsible for resolving the host name into the IP address for
         communication with a device. A DNS can be configured to get this information
         automatically when a device appears on a network or manually by an administrator. In
         contrast, *multicast DNS* (mDNS) works without a central server by querying all devices
         on a local network each time a host name needs to be resolved. mDNS is available by
         default on Linux and Mac operating systems and is used when '.local' is appended to a host
         name.

      DOF
         The Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) are the number of independent parameters for translation
         and rotation. In 3D space, 6DOF (i.e. three for translation and three rotation) are
         sufficient to describe an arbitrary position and orientation.

      GenICam
         GenICam is a generic standard interface for cameras. It serves as a unified interface
         around other standards such as :term:`GigE Vision`, Camera Link, USB, etc. See
         http://genicam.org for more information.

      GigE
         Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) is a networking technology for transmitting data at
         one gigabit per second.

      GigE Vision
         GigE Vision\ |reg| is a standard for configuring cameras and transmitting images over a
         :term:`GigE` network link. See http://gigevision.com for more information.

      IMU
         An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) consists of three accelerometers and three gyroscopes
         that measure the linear accelerations and the turn rates in all three dimensions.

      INS
         An Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a 3D measurement system which uses inertial
         measurements (accelerations and turn rates) to compute position and orientation information.
         We refer to our combination of stereo vision and inertial navigation as stereo INS.

      IP
      IP address
         The Internet Protocol (IP) is a standard for sending data between devices in a computer
         network. Every device requires an IP address, which must be unique in the network.
         The IP address can be configured by :term:`DHCP`, :term:`Link-Local`, or manually.

      Link-Local
         Link-Local is a technology where network devices associate themselves with an :term:`IP address`
         from the 169.254.0.0/16 IP range and check if it is unique in the local network.
         Link-Local can be used if
         :term:`DHCP` is unavailable and manual IP configuration is not or cannot be done.
         Link-Local is especially useful for connecting a network device directly to a
         host computer. By default, Windows 10 reverts automatically to Link-Local if
         DHCP is unavailable. Under Linux, Link-Local must be enabled manually in the network
         manager.

      MAC address
         The Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique, persistent address for
         networking devices. It is also known as the hardware address of a device. In contrast
         to the :term:`IP address`, the MAC address is (normally) permanently given to
         a device and does not change.

      NTP
         The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a TCP/IP protocol for synchronizing time over a network.
         Basically a client requests the current time from a server, and uses it to set its own clock.

      PTP
         The Precision Time Protocol (PTP, also known as IEEE1588) is a protocol which enables more precise
         and robust clock synchronization than with NTP.

      .. pose
      ..   A pose represents an object's *position* and *orientation*
      ..   relative to some *reference coordinate system* or *reference frame*.
      ..   It can be described by means of a rotation and translation transformation
      ..   that brings the object from a reference pose to the observed pose.
      ..   This rotation transformation can be represented in different ways, e.g.,
      ..   as a rotation matrix or a quaternion.

      .. rectification
      .. rectified
      ..   Rectification is a transformation process for images. In a stereo camera setting,
      ..   both images are often projected onto a common plane with parallel optical axes.
      ..   The resulting rectified images are free of lens distortion. Moreover,
      ..   an object point in the scene is always projected into the same row in both images.
      ..   The column index will be the same if the object point is at infinity. For closer
      ..   objects, the column index in the right image will be smaller than in the left image.

      SDK
         A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools or
         a collection of software components.

      SLAM
         SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping and describes the process of
         creating a map of an unknown environment and simultaneously updating the sensor pose
         within the map.

      SGM
         SGM stands for Semi-Global Matching and is a state-of-the-art stereo matching algorithm
         which offers brief run times and a great accuracy, especially at object borders, fine
         structures, and in weakly textured areas.

      TCP
         The Tool Center Point (TCP) is the position of the tool at the end effector of
         a robot. The position and orientation of the TCP determines the position and
         orientation of the tool in 3D space.

      UDP
         The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the minimal message-oriented transport
         layer of the Internet Protocol (:term:`IP`) family. It uses a simple
         connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism
         such as integrity verification (via checksum). The |rc_xxx| uses UDP
         for publishing its
         :ref:`estimated dynamical states <sect-dynamics-streams>`:latex:`\:(Section
         \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics-streams})`
         via the
         :ref:`rc_dynamics interface <sect-rc-dynamics-interface>`:latex:`\:(Section
         \ref{rc_dynamics:sect-rc-dynamics-interface})`.
         To receive this data, applications may use datagram sockets to
         bind to the endpoint of the data transmission consisting of a combination
         of an :term:`IP address` and a service port number such as
         ``192.168.0.100:49500``, which is typically referred to as a
         *destination* of an rc_dynamics data stream in this documentation.

      URI
      URL
         A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters
         identifying resources of the |rc_xxx|'s |restapi|. An example of such a
         URI is ``/nodes/rc_camera/parameters/fps``, which points
         to the ``fps`` run-time parameter of the stereo camera module.

         A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) additionally specifies the full
         network location and protocol, i.e., an exemplary URL to locate the
         above resource would be
         ``https://<ip>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters/fps``
         where ``<ip>`` refers to the |rc_xxx|'s :term:`IP address`.

      XYZABC
         Format to represent a pose. See :ref:`sect-xyzabc-format`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{pose_format_kuka:sect-xyzabc-format})`
         for its definition.

      XYZ+quaternion
         Format to represent a pose. See :ref:`sect-xyz-quaternion-format`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{pose_format_rt:sect-xyz-quaternion-format})`
         for its definition.
