3D modules
==========

The |rc_xxx|'s 3D camera software consists of the following modules:

.. only:: rc_cube

   - :doc:`stereo_matching` (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)
      uses the rectified stereo image pairs of the connected stereo camera, e.g. the |rc_visard|, to compute 3D depth
      information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
      These are provided as GenICam streams, too. This module only runs on pipeline types for stereo cameras, i.e. 
      |stereo_pipelines|.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

   - :doc:`stereo_matching` (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)
      uses the rectified stereo image pairs to compute 3D depth
      information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
      These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

.. only:: rc_cube and roboception

   - :doc:`zivid` (``rc_zivid``:latex:`, Section \ref{zivid:sect-zivid}`)
      provides 3D depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images of the connected
      |zivid| structured light camera.
      These are provided as GenICam streams, too. This module only runs on pipelines of type ``zivid``.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or schunk or basler)

   - :doc:`blaze` (``rc_blaze``:latex:`, Section \ref{blaze:sect-blaze}`)
      provides 3D depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images of the connected
      Basler |blaze| RGB-D camera. These are provided as GenICam streams, too. This module only runs 
      on pipelines of type ``blaze``.

.. only:: rc_cube

   These modules are pipeline specific, which means that they run inside each
   camera pipeline. Changes to their settings or parameters
   only affect the corresponding pipeline and have no influence on the other
   camera pipelines running on the |rc_cube|.

The 3D modules, which provide time-stamped 3D depth information such as disparity,
error, and confidence images, are also accessible via the |rc_xxx|'s
:doc:`GigE Vision/GenICam interface<gigevision>`.
