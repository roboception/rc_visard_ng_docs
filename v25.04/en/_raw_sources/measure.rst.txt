Introduction
------------

The Measure module allows measuring of depth values in a specific region of interest.

The Measure module is an on-board module of the |rc_xxx|.

.. _sect-measure-measure-depth:

Measuring Depth
---------------

The Measure module provides functionality to measure depth values in the current scene in a 2D region of interest.
Optionally, the region of interest can be subdivided into up to 100 cells, for which separate depth measurements
are returned in addition to the overall depth measurements of the whole region.

A depth measurement consist of the average depth ``mean_z``,
the minimum depth ``min_z`` and the maximum depth ``max_z``, each containing 3D coordinates. 
The coordinates of the ``min_z`` and ``max_z`` measurements correspond to the point in the cell or overall region with
the minimum and maximum distance from the camera, respectively. The ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates of the ``mean_z`` measurements 
define a point in the center of the cell or the overall region and the ``z`` coordinate is determined by the 
average of all depth value measurements (distances from the camera) in this region. Additionally, a ``coverage`` value is
returned for each cell and the overall region, which is a number between 0 and 1 that reflects the fraction 
of valid depth values inside the respective region. A coverage value of 0 means that the cell is invalid and no
depth value could be computed.

When the external ``pose_frame`` is used for the depth measurements, all 3D coordinates are computed as described above,
but then transformed to the external frame. That means, the depth is always measured along the line of sight of 
the camera, independently of the chosen pose frame.

.. _sect-measure-dependencies:

Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the Measure module depends on, and interacts with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the Measure module.

.. _sect-measure-stereo-camera-matching:

Depth Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Measure module internally makes use of the following data:

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng or matrixvision

   - Disparity images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`), in case a stereo camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)
   
   - Disparity images from the :doc:`blaze`
     (``rc_blaze``:latex:`, Section \ref{blaze:sect-blaze}`), in case a Basler |blaze| camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and roboception

   - Disparity images from the :doc:`zivid`
     (``rc_zivid``:latex:`, Section \ref{zivid:sect-zivid}`), in case a |zivid| camera is used


.. _sect-measure-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the Measure module
can automatically provide points in the robot coordinate frame.
For the Measure node's :ref:`sect-measure-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{measure:sect-measure-services})`, the frame of the
output points can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All points provided by the module are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured points
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All points provided by the module are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: **Request**

            Required arguments:

               ``pose_frame``: see :ref:`sect-measure-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{measure:sect-measure-hand-eye-dep})`.

            Optional arguments:
      
               ``region_of_interest_2d_id`` is the ID of the 2D region of interest (see :ref:`sect-roi`:latex:`, Section \ref{roi:sect-roi}`)
               that will be used for the depth measurements.

               ``region_of_interest_2d`` is an alternative on-the-fly definition of the region of interest for the depth measurements. 
               This region of interest will be ignored if a ``region_of_interest_2d_id`` is given. The region of interest is always defined
               on the camera image with full resolution, where ``offset_x`` and ``offset_y`` are the pixel coordinates of the upper left corner
               of the rectangular region of interest, and ``width`` and ``height`` are the width and height of it in pixels.
               Default is a region of interest covering the whole image.

               ``cell_count`` is the number of cells in x and y direction into which the region of interest is divided. 
               If not given, a cell count of 0, 0 is assumed and only the overall values will be computed. The total cell count is
               computed as product of the x and y values must not exceed 100.

               ``data_acquisition_mode``: if set to ``CAPTURE_NEW`` (default), a new image dataset will be used for the measurement.
               If set to ``USE_LAST``, the previous dataset will be used for the measurement.

            Potentially required arguments:

               ``robot_pose``: see :ref:`sect-measure-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{measure:sect-measure-hand-eye-dep})`.

         .. tab:: **Response**

            ``cells`` contains the depth measurements of all requested cells. The cells are always ordered from left to right and top
            to bottom in image coordinates.
            
            ``overall`` contains the depth measurements of the full region of interest.

            ``coverage`` contains the valid pixel ratio as described in 
            :ref:`sect-measure-measure-depth`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{measure:sect-measure-measure-depth})`.

            ``mean_z``, ``min_z`` and ``max_z`` contains the measurement coordinates as described in 
            :ref:`sect-measure-measure-depth`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{measure:sect-measure-measure-depth})`.

            ``region_of_interest_2d`` returns the definition of the requested region of interest for the depth measurement.

            ``pose_frame`` contains the pose frame of the depth measurement coordinates.

.. _sect-measure-return-codes:

Return codes
------------

.. index::
   pair: Measure; return codes

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.

The following table contains a list of common codes:

.. tabularcolumns:: |c|L|
.. _tab-measure-return-codes:
.. csv-table:: Return codes of the Measure module's services
    :header:  Code, Description

    "0",    "Success"
