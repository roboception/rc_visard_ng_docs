Overview

The 3D sensor

rc_visard NG

 is an IP54-protected  stereo-camera with on-board computing
capabilities.

The

rc_visard NG

 provides real-time camera images and depth images, which can be used
to compute 3D point clouds. Additionally, it provides confidence and
error images as quality measures for each image acquisition. It offers
an intuitive web UI (user interface) and a standardized GenICam
interface, making it compatible with all major image processing
libraries.

With optionally available software modules the

rc_visard NG

 provides out-of-the-box solutions for object detection and robotic
pick-and-place applications.

The

rc_visard NG

's intuitive calibration, configuration, and use enable 3D vision for
everyone.


The terms "sensor" and "

rc_visard NG

" used throughout the manual all refer to the Roboception

rc_visard NG

.

Note: This manual uses the metric system and mostly uses the units
  meter and millimeter. Unless otherwise specified, all dimensions in
