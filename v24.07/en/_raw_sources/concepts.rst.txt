Measurement principles
======================

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    The |rc_xxx| is a self-registering 3D camera. It provides rectified camera,
    disparity, confidence, and error images, which enable the viewed scene's depth values along
    with their uncertainties to be computed. Furthermore, the motion of visual features in the
    images is combined with acceleration and turn-rate measurements at a high rate, which
    enables the sensor to provide real-time estimates of its current pose, velocity, and acceleration.

.. only:: rc_cube

    The |rc_xxx| is a high-performance 3D-image-processing device that is used
    in combination one or more 3D cameras such as |company|'s 3D camera |rc_visard|. 
    Together, they provide rectified camera,
    disparity, confidence, and error images, which allow the viewed scene's depth values along
    with their uncertainties to be computed.

In the following, the underlying measurement principles are explained in more detail.
