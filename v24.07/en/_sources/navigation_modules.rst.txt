Navigation modules

The

rc_visard NG

's navigation modules contain:

dynamics (rc_dynamics, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics})  provides
estimates of rc_visard's dynamic state such as its pose, velocity, and
acceleration. These states are transmitted as continuous data streams
via the rc_dynamics interface. For this purpose, the dynamics module
manages and fuses data from the following individual subcomponents:
stereo_visodo (rc_stereovisodo, Section \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-
visual-odometry})  estimates the motion of the rc_visard device based
on the motion of characteristic visual features in the left camera
images.  stereo_ins (rc_stereo_ins, Section \ref{stereo_ins:sect-
stereo-ins})  combines visual odometry measurements with readings from
the on-board Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to provide accurate and
high-frequency state estimates in real time.  slam (rc_slam, Section
\ref{slam:sect-slam})  performs simultaneous localization and mapping
for correcting accumulated poses. The rc_visard's covered trajectory
is offered via the REST-API interface\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-
rest-api}).
