Time synchronization

The

rc_visard NG

 provides timestamps with all images and messages. To compare these
with the time on the application host, the time needs to be properly
synchronized.

   This can be done either via the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which
   is the default, or the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).

The current system time as well as time synchronization status can be
queried via

REST-API

 and seen on the

Web GUI

's

System

 page.

Note: Depending on the reachability of NTP servers or PTP masters it
  might take up to several minutes until the time is synchronized.

NTP

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a TCP/IP protocol for synchronizing
time over a network. A client periodically requests the current time
from a server, and uses it to set and correct its own clock.

By default the

rc_visard NG

 tries to reach NTP servers from the NTP Pool Project, which will work
if the

rc_visard NG

 has access to the internet.

If the

rc_visard NG

 is configured for

DHCP

 (which is the default setting), it will also request NTP servers from
the DHCP server and try to use those.

Additionally, the user can specify up to three NTP servers manually
using the REST-API's

/system/ntp

 endpoint. A more convenient way is setting the NTP servers on the

Web GUI

's

System Time

 page.

PTP

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP, also known as IEEE1588) is a
protocol which offers more precise and robust clock synchronization
than with NTP.

The

rc_visard

 can be configured to act as a PTP slave via the standard

GigE Vision 2.0/GenICam interface

 using the "GevIEEE1588" parameter.

At least one PTP master providing time has to be running in the
network. On Linux the respective command for starting a PTP master on
ethernet port "eth0" is, e.g., "sudo ptpd --masteronly --foreground -i
eth0".

While the

rc_visard

 is synchronized with a PTP master (

rc_visard

 in PTP status SLAVE), the NTP synchronization is paused.

Setting time manually

The

rc_visard NG

 allows to set the current date and time manually using the REST-API's

/system/time

 endpoint, if no time synchronization is active (see

System and logs

). A more convenient way is setting the system time on the

Web GUI

's

System Time

 page.
