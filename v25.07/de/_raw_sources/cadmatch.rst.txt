Introduction
------------

.. Short description and functionalities

The |cadm| module is an optional module of the |rc_xxx| and requires a separate |cadm| :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or schunk or basler)

   .. note:: This module is not available in camera pipelines of type ``blaze``.

This module provides an out-of-the-box perception solution for 3D object detection and grasping.
|cadm| targets the detection of 3D objects based on a CAD template for picking
with a general gripper. The objects can be located in a bin or placed arbitrarily in the
field of view of the camera. :ngonly:`However, their approximate poses must be known in advance and specified as pose priors.` 

For the |cadm| module to work, special object templates are required for each type of object to
be detected. Please get in touch with the |manufacturer| support (:ref:`sect-contact`:latex:`,
Section \ref{contact:sect-contact}`) to order a template for your CAD file.

.. only:: rc_cube

   .. note::

      This module is pipeline specific. Changes to its settings or parameters only affect
      the respective camera pipeline and have no influence on other pipelines running on the |rc_cube|.

      However, the object templates, grasp points and pose priors are stored globally. Setting, changing
      or deleting an object template, its grasps or pose priors affects all camera pipelines.


The |cadm| module offers:

- A dedicated page on the |rc_xxx| :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
  for easy setup, configuration, testing, and application tuning.
- A :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` and a
  :doc:`eki`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{eki:sect-eki})`.
- The definition of regions of interest to select relevant volumes in the scene
  (see :ref:`sect-roi`:latex:`, Section \ref{roi:sect-roi}`).
- A load carrier detection functionality for bin-picking applications
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
  to provide grasps for objects inside a bin only.
- The definition of compartments inside a load carrier to provide grasps
  for specific volumes of the bin only.
- :cubeonly:`The option to use user-defined object pose priors.`:ngonly:`An interactive 3D visualization for the definition of pose priors in the Web GUI.`
- Storing of up to 50 templates.
- The definition of up to 100 grasp points for each template via an interactive visualization in the |webgui|.
- Collision checking between the gripper and the load carrier, other detected objects and/or the point cloud.
- Collision checking between the object in the gripper and the load carrier walls during retraction.
- Support for static and robot-mounted cameras and
  optional integration with the :doc:`handeye_calibration`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})` module,
  to provide grasps in the user-configured external reference frame.
- Selection of a sorting strategy to sort the detected objects and returned grasps.
- 3D visualization of the detection results with grasp points and gripper animations in the |webgui|.

.. _sect-cadmatch-grasps:

Setting of grasp points
-----------------------

.. index::
   single: CADMatch; grasp points
   single: CADMatch; object template

The |cadm| module detects 3D objects in a scene based on a CAD template and returns the
poses of the object origins. To use |cadm| directly in a robot application, up to 100 grasp points
can be defined for each template. A grasp point represents the desired position and orientation
of the robot's TCP (Tool Center Point) to grasp an object.

Please consult :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-grasps`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-grasps})` for further details.

Setting grasp points in the |webgui|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |rc_xxx| |webgui| provides an intuitive and interactive way of defining grasp points for object templates.
In a first step, the object template has to be uploaded to the |rc_xxx|. This can be done
in the |webgui| in any pipeline under :menuselection:`Modules --> CADMatch`
by clicking on :guilabel:`+ Add a new Template` in the
*Templates, Grasps and Pose Priors* section, or in :menuselection:`Database --> Templates` in the
*CADMatch Templates, Grasps and Pose Priors* section. Once the
template upload is complete, a dialog with a 3D visualization of the object template is shown
for adding or editing grasp
points. The same dialog appears when editing an existing template.

More details are given in
:ref:`sect-silhouettematch-grasps-webgui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-grasps-webgui})`.

Setting grasp points via the |rest-api|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grasp points can be set via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
using the ``set_grasp`` or ``set_all_grasps`` services
(see :ref:`sect-cadmatch-internal-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-internal-services}`).

More details are given in :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-grasps-rest-api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-grasps-rest-api})`.

.. _sect-cadmatch-pose-priors:

Setting of pose priors
----------------------

.. index::
   single: CADMatch; pose priors
   single: CADMatch; object template

The |cadm| module :cubeonly:`offers the possibility`:ngonly:`requires the user` to define prior poses of the objects to be detected.
:cubeonly:`If a pose prior is given, the object detection will use this pose prior and only refine the given pose. This speeds up the detection significantly.`:ngonly:`The pose priors will be refined to estimate the true poses of the objects.` A pose prior represents the approximate
position and orientation of the object to be detected. The pose can be defined in the camera or
the external coordinate frame, if a hand-eye calibration is available.

Each pose prior consists of an ``id`` which must be
unique within all pose priors for an object template, the ``template_id`` representing the template the pose
prior applies to, the ``pose`` and the ``pose_frame`` of the prior.
Pose priors can be set via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`,
or by using the interactive visualization in the |webgui|. The |webgui| allows to interactively position the object
in the current point cloud. This can be done in the "Pose Priors" tab during editing a template.

:cubeonly:`Pose priors should be used in applications where the approximate object poses are known beforehand.`
The |rcxxx| can store up to 50 pose priors per template.

.. _sect-cadmatch-set-preferred-orientation:

Setting the preferred orientation of the TCP
--------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: CADMatch; preferred orientation

The |cadm| module determines the reachability of grasp points based on the *preferred orientation* of the
TCP. The preferred orientation can be set via the ``set_preferred_orientation`` service call or on
the *CADMatch* page in the |webgui|.
The resulting direction of the TCP's z axis is used to reject grasps which cannot be reached by the gripper.
Furthermore, the preferred orientation can be used to sort the reachable grasps by setting the corresponding
sorting strategy.

The preferred orientation can be set in the camera coordinate frame or in the external coordinate frame, in case
a hand-eye calibration is available. If the preferred orientation is specified in the external coordinate frame
and the sensor is robot mounted, the current robot pose has to be given to each object detection call.
If no preferred orientation is set, the orientation of the left camera 
(see :ref:`rcvisard:sect-coordinate-frames` :cubeonly:`in the rc_visard manual`) will be used as the preferred orientation of the TCP.

.. _sect-cadmatch-set-sorting-strategies:

Setting the sorting strategies
------------------------------

The objects and grasps returned by the ``detect_object`` service call are sorted according to a sorting strategy which can be
chosen by the user. The following sorting strategies are available and
can be set in the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
or using the ``set_sorting_strategies`` service call:

- ``gravity``: highest matches and grasp points along the gravity direction are returned first,
- ``match_score``: matches with the highest match score and grasp points on objects with the highest match score are returned first,
- ``preferred_orientation``: matches and grasp points with minimal rotation difference of a chosen ``axis`` (or all axes, when ``axis`` is empty) with respect to the preferred TCP orientation are returned first,
- ``direction``: matches and grasp points with the shortest distance along a defined direction ``vector`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.
- ``distance_to_point``: matches and grasp points with the shortest or farthest (if ``farthest_first`` is true) distance from a ``point`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.

If no sorting strategy is set or default sorting is chosen in the |webgui|, sorting is done based on a combination of
``match_score`` and the minimal distance from the camera along the z axis of the preferred orientation of the TCP.


.. _sect-cadmatch-detect-objects:

Detection of objects
--------------------

.. index::
   single: CADMatch; object detection
   single: CADMatch; object template
   single: CADMatch; sorting

The |cadm| module requires an object template for object detection. This template contains
information about the 3D shape of the object and prominent edges that can be visible in the
camera images. |cadm| also supports partial object templates, which contain only a specific
part of the object that can be detected well, e.g., in case of occlusions. 
:cubeonly:`Furthermore, templates can require a pose prior for the detection which is then only refined using the image data.`

.. only:: rc_cube

   The object detection is a two-stage process consisting of a prior estimation step and a pose refinement step.
   First, a pose prior is computed based on the appearance
   of the object in the camera images. Second, the pose is refined by using the 3D point cloud and
   edges in the camera image. For this to work, the objects to detect must be visible in both left and right camera images.
   If pose priors are given, only the pose refinement step is performed based, which decreases runtime significantly.

.. only:: rc_visard_ng

   The object detection uses the user-defined pose priors and refines them with the 3D point cloud and
   edges in the camera image. For this to work, the objects to detect must be visible in both left and right camera images.

For triggering the object detection, in general, the following information
can be provided to the |cadm| module:

.. only:: rc_visard_ng

   - The template ID of the object to be detected in the scene
   - The IDs of the pose priors which approximately match the poses of the objects to be detected.
   - The coordinate frame in which the poses of the detected objects and the grasp points shall be returned (ref. :ref:`sect-cadmatch-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-hand-eye-dep}`).

.. only:: rc_cube

   - The template ID of the object to be detected in the scene
   - The coordinate frame in which the poses of the detected objects and the grasp points shall be returned (ref. :ref:`sect-cadmatch-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-hand-eye-dep}`).

Optionally, further information can be given to the |cadm| module:

.. only:: rc_cube
  
  - The IDs of the pose priors which approximately match the poses of the objects to be detected. In case a template is used that requires a pose prior, one or more pose prior IDs have to be provided.

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be detected.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to detect objects (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-compartment`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier_db:sect-loadcarrier-compartment}`).
- The ID of the 3D region of interest where to search for the load carriers if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the 3D region of interest where to search for the objects.
- The current robot pose in case the camera is mounted on the robot and
  the chosen coordinate frame for the poses is ``external``, or the preferred orientation
  is given in the external frame, or the chosen region of interest is defined in the external frame.
- Collision detection information: The ID of the gripper to enable collision checking and optionally
  a pre-grasp offset to define a pre-grasp position.
  Details on collision
  checking are given below in :ref:`sect-cadmatch-collision-check-dep`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-collision-check-dep})`.
- Data acquisition mode: The user can choose if a new image dataset is acquired for the detection (default), or if the detection should be
  performed on the previously used image dataset. This saves data acquisition time, e.g. in case several detections with different
  templates have to be run on the same image.

On the |webgui| the detection can be tested in the *Try Out* section of the |cadm| module's page.

The detected objects are returned in a list of ``matches``, sorted according to the selected sorting strategy
(see :ref:`sect-cadmatch-set-sorting-strategies`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-set-sorting-strategies}`).
Each detected object
includes a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier) and the
``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to detect it.
The ``pose`` of a detected object corresponds to the pose of the origin of the object template used for detection.
Furthermore, the matching ``score`` is given to indicate the quality of the detection.

If the chosen template also has grasp points attached
(see :ref:`sect-cadmatch-grasps`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-grasps}`),
a list of ``grasps`` for all objects is returned in addition to the list of detected objects.
The grasps are sorted according to the selected sorting strategy
(see :ref:`sect-cadmatch-set-sorting-strategies`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-set-sorting-strategies}`).
The grasp poses are given in the desired coordinate frame. There are references between the detected objects
and the grasps via their ``uuids``.

For objects with a discrete symmetry (e.g. prismatic objects), all collision-free symmetries of
each grasp point which are reachable according to the given preferred
TCP orientation are returned, ordered by the given sorting strategy.

For objects with a continuous symmetry (e.g. cylindrical objects), all grasps symmetric
to each grasp point on an object are checked for reachability and collisions, and only the
best one according to the given sorting strategy is returned.

.. only:: rc_cube
 
   .. Note::
      The first detection call with a new object template takes longer than the following detection calls,
      because the object template has to be loaded into the |cadm| module first. To avoid this, the
      ``warmup_template`` service can be used to load a template so that it is ready when the first detection
      is triggered.
   
.. _sect-cadmatch-dependencies:

Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the |cadm| module depends on, and interacts with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the |cadm| modules.


.. _sect-cadmatch-stereo-camera-matching:

Camera and depth data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |cadm| module makes internally use of the following data:

- Rectified images from the :doc:`camera`
  (``rc_camera``:latex:`, Section \ref{camera:sect-camera}`)

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng or matrixvision

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`).
     The ``quality`` parameter of the stereo matching module must be set to ``Medium``
     or higher (see :ref:`sect-disp-image-parameters`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`). 
     We recommend ``Full`` or ``High`` quality for using |cadm|.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`), in case a stereo camera is used.
     The ``quality`` parameter of the stereo matching module must be set to ``Medium``
     or higher (see :ref:`sect-disp-image-parameters`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`). 
     We recommend ``Full`` or ``High`` quality for using |cadm|.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`blaze`
     (``rc_blaze``:latex:`, Section \ref{blaze:sect-blaze}`), in case a Basler |blaze| camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and roboception

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`zivid`
     (``rc_zivid``:latex:`, Section \ref{zivid:sect-zivid}`), in case a |zivid| camera is used

All processed images are guaranteed to be captured after the module trigger time.

.. _sect-cadmatch-iocontrol-dep:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and
the :doc:`iocontrol` module (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`),
it is recommended to connect the projector to GPIO Out 1 and set
the stereo-camera module's acquisition mode to ``SingleFrameOut1``
(see :ref:`Stereo matching parameters<sect-disp-image-parameters>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`), so that
on each image acquisition trigger an image with and without projector pattern is acquired.

Alternatively, the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set to ``ExposureAlternateActive``
(see :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params}`).

In either case,
the *Auto Exposure Mode* ``exp_auto_mode`` should be set to ``AdaptiveOut1`` to optimize the exposure
of both images.

.. _sect-cadmatch-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the |cadm| module
can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the |cadm| node's :ref:`sect-cadmatch-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch-services})`, the frame of the
output poses can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   This means that the configured regions of interest and load carriers move with the camera.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured poses
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.

If the sensor is robot-mounted, the current ``robot_pose`` has to be provided depending on the value of ``pose_frame``,
the definition of the preferred TCP orientation and the sorting direction or sorting point:

- If ``pose_frame`` is set to ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the preferred TCP orientation is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the sorting direction is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the distance-to-point sorting strategy is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- In all other cases, providing the robot pose is optional.

.. _sect-cadmatch-load-carrier-dep:

LoadCarrier
^^^^^^^^^^^

The |cadm| module uses the load carrier detection functionality provided by the
:doc:`loadcarrier` module (``rc_load_carrier``:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
with the run-time parameters specified for this module. However, only one load carrier will be
returned and used in case multiple matching load carriers could be found in the scene. In case multiple
load carriers of the same type are visible, a region of interest should be set to ensure that always the
same load carrier is used for the |cadm| module.

.. _sect-cadmatch-collision-check-dep:

CollisionCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: CADMatch; collision check

Collision checking can be easily enabled for
grasp computation of the |cadm| module by  passing a ``collision_detection`` argument to the
``detect_object`` service call. It contains the ID of the used gripper and
optionally a pre-grasp offset. The gripper has to be
defined in the GripperDB module
(see :ref:`sect-gripper-db-gripper`:latex:`, Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripper-db-gripper}`)
and details about collision checking are given in
:ref:`sect-collision-check-other-modules`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-other-modules})`.

Alternatively, grasp points can be assigned individual gripper IDs, and collision checking can be enabled for all
grasp points with gripper IDs by enabling the run-time parameter ``check_collisions``.

If the selected |cadm| template contains a collision geometry and the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_with_matches`` is true,
also collisions between the gripper and all other detected objects (not limited to ``max_matches``) will be checked. The object
on which the grasp point to be checked is located, is excluded from the collision check.

If the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_with_point_cloud`` is true,
also collisions between the gripper and a watertight version of the point cloud are checked.
If this feature is used with suctions grippers, it should be ensured that the TCP is defined
to be outside the gripper geometry, or that the grasp points are defined above the object surface.
Otherwise every grasp will result in a collision between the gripper and the point cloud.

If the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_during_retraction`` is true and a load carrier and a pre-grasp offset are given,
each grasp point will be checked for collisions between the object in the gripper and the load carrier walls during retraction.
This collision check is performed along the full linear trajectory from the grasp point back to the pre-grasp position.

If collision checking is enabled, only grasps which are collision free or could not be checked for collisions
(e.g. because no gripper was given) will be returned.
The result image on top of the *CADMatch*
page of the |webgui| also shows collision-free grasps in green, unchecked grasps in yellow and colliding grasp points in red.
The detected objects which are considered in the collision check are also visualized with their edges in red.

The CollisionCheck module's run-time parameters affect the collision detection as described in
:ref:`CollisionCheck Parameters<sect-collisioncheck-parameters>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

      determines the method that is used to select which of the detected priors (initial pose estimates) will be refined.
      Available options are
      ``MatchSorting`` and ``PriorAccessibility``. When ``MatchSorting`` is chosen, the priors are selected according to the 
      chosen sorting strategy. This is the default mode. When ``PriorAccessibility`` is chosen, the priors are selected 
      according to their accessibility for grasping. This mode should be used for chaotic scenes with many overlapping 
      objects, e.g. in bin picking.

      Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

Return codes
------------

.. index::
   pair: CADMatch; return codes

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.

The following table contains a list of common codes:
