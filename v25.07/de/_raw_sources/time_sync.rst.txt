Time synchronization
====================

.. index::
   pair: time; synchronization

The |rc_xxx| provides timestamps with all images and messages.
To compare these with the time on the application host, the time needs to be properly synchronized.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    This can be done either via the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is the default, or the Precision Time
    Protocol (PTP).

   .. only:: rc_visard

      .. Note:: The |rc_visard| does not have a backup battery for its real time clock and hence does not retain time across power cycles.
               The system time starts at the last saved time (saved on reboot and every 15 minutes) at power up and is then automatically set via
               NTP if a server can be found.

.. only:: rc_cube

    The time synchronization between the |rc_xxx| and the application host can be done via the
    Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is activated by default.

    Internal time synchronization between the |rc_xxx| and the connected camera is automatically done via
    the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).

The current system time as well as time synchronization status can be queried via
:doc:`REST-API<rest_api>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` and seen on the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})` *System* page.

.. Note:: Depending on the reachability of NTP servers or PTP masters it might take up to several minutes until the time is synchronized.

.. _sect-ntp:

NTP
---

.. index::
   pair: NTP; synchronization

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a TCP/IP protocol for synchronizing time over a network.
A client periodically requests the current time from a server, and uses it to set and correct
its own clock.

By default the |rc_xxx| tries to reach NTP servers from the NTP Pool Project,
which will work if the |rc_xxx| has access to the internet.

If the |rc_xxx| is configured for :ref:`DHCP<sect-auto-network-configuration>`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{installation:sect-auto-network-configuration})`
(which is the default setting), it will also request NTP servers from the DHCP server and try to
use those.

Additionally, the user can specify up to three NTP servers manually using the |restapi|'s **/system/ntp** endpoint.
A more convenient way is setting the NTP servers on the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
*System Time* page.

.. _sect-ptp:

PTP
---

.. index::
   pair: PTP; synchronization

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP, also known as IEEE1588) is a protocol which offers more precise and robust clock synchronization than with NTP.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    The |rc_visard| can be configured to act as a PTP slave via the standard :doc:`GigE Vision 2.0/GenICam interface<gigevision>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam})` using the ``GevIEEE1588`` parameter.

    At least one PTP master providing time has to be running in the network.
    On Linux the respective command for starting a PTP master on ethernet port ``eth0`` is, e.g., ``sudo ptpd --masteronly --foreground -i eth0``.

    While the |rc_visard| is synchronized with a PTP master (|rc_visard| in PTP status SLAVE), the NTP synchronization is paused.

.. only:: rc_cube

    .. Note:: Currently, time synchronization between the application host and the |rc_xxx| is not implemented.
              Please use NTP instead.

.. _sect-manual-time:

Setting time manually
---------------------

.. index::
   pair: time; set

The |rc_xxx| allows to set the current date and time manually using the |restapi|'s **/system/time** endpoint,
if no time synchronization is active (see :doc:`rest_api_syslogs`:latex:`, Section \ref{rest_api_syslogs:sect-rest-api-syslogs}`).
A more convenient way is setting the system time on the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
*System Time* page.
