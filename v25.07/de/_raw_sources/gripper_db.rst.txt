Introduction
------------

The GripperDB module (gripper database module) is an optional on-board module of the |rcxxx| and is licensed with 
any of the modules |pick_modules| or |match_modules|. 
Otherwise it requires a separate CollisionCheck :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

The module provides services to set, retrieve and delete grippers which can then be used
for checking collisions with a load carrier or other detected objects 
(only in combination with |match_modules|). The specified grippers are available for all
modules supporting collision checking on the |rc_xxx|.

   .. note::
   
      This module is global on the |rc_cube|. Changes to its settings or parameters affect
      every camera pipeline running on the |rc_cube|.

Setting a gripper
------------------

The gripper is a collision geometry used to determine whether the grasp is in collision with the load carrier.
The gripper consists of up to 15 elements connected to each other.

At this point, the gripper can be built of elements of the following types:

 - ``BOX``, with dimensions ``box.x``, ``box.y``, ``box.z``.
 - ``CYLINDER``, with radius ``cylinder.radius`` and height ``cylinder.height``.
 - ``CAD``, with the id ``cad.id`` of the chosen CAD element.

Additionally, for each gripper the flange radius, and information about the Tool Center Point (TCP) have to
be defined.

The configuration of the gripper is normally performed offline during the setup of the desired application.
This can be done via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or the |rcxxx|
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.

.. _sect-gripperdb-flange:

Robot flange radius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collisions are checked only with the gripper, the robot body is not considered.
As a safety feature, to prevent collisions between the load carrier and the robot, all grasps having any part of the
robot's flange inside the load carrier can be designated as colliding (see :numref:`fig-collision-check-gripper-flange-radius`).
This check is based on the defined gripper geometry and the flange radius value. It is optional to use
this functionality, and it can be turned on and off with the CollisionCheck module's run-time parameter ``check_flange`` as described
in :ref:`sect-collisioncheck-parameters`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

.. _fig-collision-check-gripper-flange-radius:
.. figure:: images/check_flange.*
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Case A would be marked as collision only if ``check_flange`` is true, because the robot's flange (red) is inside the 
   load carrier. Case B is collision free independent of ``check_flange``.


.. _sect-gripperdb-cad-elements:

Uploading gripper CAD elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A gripper can consist of boxes, cylinders and CAD elements. While boxes and cylinders can be parameterized when
the gripper is created, the CAD elements must be uploaded beforehand to be available during gripper creation.
A CAD element can be uploaded via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` as described
in Section :ref:`sect-gripperdb-cad-element-upload`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripperdb-cad-element-upload})`
or via the |rcxxx| :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.
Supported file formats are STEP (\*.stp, \*.step), STL (\*.stl), OBJ (\*.obj) and PLY (\*.ply). 
The maximum file size to be uploaded is limited to :visardonly:`10` :ngonly:`30` :cubeonly:`30` MB.
The files are internally converted to PLY and, if necessary, simplified. 
The CAD elements can be referenced during gripper creation by their ID.

.. _sect-gripperdb-gripper-creation:

Creating a gripper via the |rest-api| or the |webgui|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating a gripper via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`,
each element of the gripper has a `parent` element, which defines how they are connected.
The gripper is always built in the direction from the robot flange to the TCP, and at least one element must
have 'flange' as parent. The elements' IDs must be unique and must not be 'tcp' or 'flange'.
The pose of the child element has to be given in the coordinate frame of the parent element.
The coordinate frame of an element is always in its
geometric center. Accordingly, for a child element to be exactly below the parent element, the position of
the child element must be computed from the heights of both parent and child element
(see :numref:`fig-collision-check-gripper-frames-restapi`).

   :align: center

   Reference frames for gripper creation via the |rest-api| and the |webgui|

In case a CAD element is used, the element's origin is defined in the CAD data and is not necessarily located
in the center of the element's bounding box.

It is recommended to create a gripper via the |webgui|, because it provides a 3D visualization of the
gripper geometry and also allows to automatically attach the child element to the bottom of its parent element, when the
corresponding option for this element is activated. In this case, the elements also stay attached when
any of their sizes change. Automatic attachment of CAD elements uses the element's bounding box as reference.
Automatic attachment is only possible when the child element is not rotated around the x or y axis with respect to its parent.

The reference frame for the first element for the gripper creation is always the center of the robot's flange
with the z axis pointing outwards. It is possible to create a gripper with a tree structure,
corresponding to multiple elements having the same parent element, as long as they are all connected.

Calculated TCP position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After gripper creation via the ``set_gripper`` service call, the TCP position in the flange coordinate
system is calculated and returned as ``tcp_pose_flange``.
It is important to check if this value is the same as the robot's true TCP position. When creating a 
gripper in the |webgui| the current TCP position is always displayed in the 3D gripper visualization.

Creating rotationally asymmetric grippers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For grippers which are not rotationally symmetric around the z axis, it is crucial to ensure that the gripper is properly mounted,
so that the representation stored in the GripperDB module corresponds to reality.

.. _sect-gripperdb-services:

Services
--------

The GripperDB module is called ``rc_gripper_db`` in the |rest-api| and is represented in the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})` under 
:menuselection:`Database --> Grippers`.
The user can explore and call the GripperDB module's services,
e.g. for development and testing, using the
:doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or
the |webgui|.

The GripperDB module offers the following services.

.. _expl-gripper-db-srv-set-gripper:

``set_gripper``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Persistently stores a gripper on the |rc_xxx|.
   All configured grippers are persistent over firmware updates and rollbacks.

   .. toggle-header::
      :header: **Details**

      This service can be called as follows.

      .. code-block:: bash

         PUT http://<host>/api/v2/nodes/rc_gripper_db/services/set_gripper

            Required arguments:

               ``elements``: list of geometric elements for the gripper.
               Each element must be of ``type`` 'CYLINDER' or 'BOX' with the corresponding dimensions in
               the ``cylinder`` or ``box`` field, or of type 'CAD' with the corresponding ``id`` in the ``cad`` field.
               The pose of each element must be given in the coordinate frame
               of the parent element (see :ref:`sect-gripper-db-gripper`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripper-db-gripper})`
               for an explanation of the coordinate frames). The element's ``id`` must be unique and must not be
               'tcp' or 'flange'. The ``parent_id`` is the ID of the parent element. It can either be 'flange'
               or it must correspond to another element in list.

               ``flange_radius``: radius of the flange used in case the ``check_flange`` run-time parameter is active.

               ``id``: unique name of the gripper

               ``tcp_parent_id``: ID of the element on which the TCP is defined

Return codes
------------

.. index::
   pair: GripperDB; return codes


Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.
