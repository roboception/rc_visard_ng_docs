Rectification

To simplify image processing, the camera module rectifies all camera
images based on the camera calibration. This means that lens
distortion is removed and the principal point is located exactly in
the middle of the image.

The model of a rectified camera is described with just one value,
which is the focal length. The

rc_visard NG

 reports a focal length factor via its various interfaces. It relates
to the image width for supporting different image resolutions. The
focal length f in pixels can be easily obtained by multiplying the
focal length factor by the image width in pixels.

In case of a stereo camera, rectification also aligns images such that
an object point is always projected onto the same image row in both
images. The cameras' optical axes become exactly parallel.
