3D modules

The

rc_visard NG

's 3D camera software consists of the following modules:

Stereo matching module (rc_stereomatching, Section
\ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching})  uses the rectified stereo
image pairs to compute 3D depth information such as disparity, error,
and confidence images. These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

The 3D modules, which provide time-stamped 3D depth information such
as disparity, error, and confidence images, are also accessible via
the

rc_visard NG

's

GigE Vision/GenICam interface
