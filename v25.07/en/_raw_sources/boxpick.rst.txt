Introduction
------------

.. Short description and functionalities

The BoxPick module provides an out-of-the-box perception solution for robotic pick-and-place
applications. It detects rectangular surfaces and determines their position,
orientation and size for grasping. With the +Match extension, BoxPick can be used to
detect textured rectangles with consistent orientations, such as printed product packaging, labels, brochures or books.

In addition, the module offers:

- A dedicated page on the |rc_xxx| :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
  for easy setup, configuration, testing, and application tuning.
- The definition of regions of interest to select relevant volumes in the scene
  (see :ref:`sect-roi`:latex:`, Section \ref{roi:sect-roi}`).
- A load carrier detection functionality for bin-picking applications
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
  to provide grasps for items inside a bin only.
- The definition of compartments inside a load carrier to provide grasps
  for specific volumes of the bin only.
- Collision checking between the gripper and the load carrier and/or the point cloud.
- Support for static and robot-mounted cameras and
  optional integration with the :doc:`handeye_calibration`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})` module,
  to provide grasps in the user-configured external reference frame.
- A quality value associated to each suggested grasp and related to the flatness of the grasping surface.
- Selection of a sorting strategy to sort the returned grasps.
- 3D visualization of the detection results with grasp points and gripper animations in the |webgui|.

.. only:: rc_cube

   .. note::

      This module is pipeline specific. Changes to its settings or parameters only affect
      the respective camera pipeline and have no influence on other pipelines running on the |rc_cube|.

.. Note::

  In this chapter, cluster and surface are used as synonyms and identify a set of
  points (or pixels) with defined geometrical properties.

The module is an optional on-board module of the |rc_xxx|
and requires a separate BoxPick :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.
The +Match extension requires an extra license.

.. _sect-boxpick-detect-items:

Detection of items
------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; item models

There are two different types of models for the rectangles to be detected by the BoxPick module.

Per default, BoxPick only supports ``item_models`` of
``type`` ``RECTANGLE``. With the +Match extension, also item models
of ``type`` ``TEXTURED_BOX`` can be detected. The detection of the
different item model types is described below.

Optionally, further information can be given to the BoxPick module:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be detected.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to detect items.
- The ID of the region of interest where to search for the load carriers if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the region of interest where to search for the items.
- The current robot pose in case the camera is mounted on the robot and
  the chosen coordinate frame for the poses is ``external`` or the chosen
  region of interest is defined in the external frame.

The returned ``pose`` of a detected ``item`` is the pose of the center of the detected rectangle in the
desired reference frame (``pose_frame``), with its z axis pointing towards the camera and the x axis
aligned with the long side of the item. This pose has a 180° rotation ambiguity around the z axis, which can be resolved
by using the +Match extension with a ``TEXTURED_BOX`` item model.
Each detected item includes a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier) and the
``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to detect it.

.. _sect-boxpick-detect-items-rectangle:

Detection of items of type RECTANGLE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; RECTANGLE

BoxPick supports multiple ``item_models`` of ``type`` ``RECTANGLE``.
Each item model is defined by its minimum and maximum size, with the
minimum dimensions strictly smaller than the maximum dimensions.
The dimensions should be given fairly accurately to avoid misdetections,
while still considering a certain tolerance to account for possible production variations
and measurement inaccuracies.

The detection of the rectangles runs in several steps. First, the point cloud is segmented into
preferably plane clusters. Then, straight line segments are detected in the 2D images
and projected onto the corresponding clusters. The clusters and the detected lines are
visualized in the "Intermediate Result" visualization
on the |webgui|'s *BoxPick* page. Finally, for each cluster, the set of
rectangles best fitting to the detected line segments is extracted.

.. _sect-boxpick-detect-items-textured-box:

Detection of items of type TEXTURED_BOX (BoxPick+Match)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; views
   single: BoxPick; texture
   single: BoxPick; TEXTURED_BOX

With the +Match extension, BoxPick additionally supports ``item_models`` of ``type`` ``TEXTURED_BOX``.
When this item model type is used, only one item model can be given for each request.

The ``TEXTURED_BOX`` item model type should be used to detect multiple rectangles that have the same texture, i.e. the same look or print,
such as printed product packaging, labels, brochures or books. It is required that for all objects the texture is at the same position with respect
to the object geometry. Furthermore, the texture should not be repetitive.

A ``TEXTURED_BOX`` item is defined by the item's exact ``dimensions`` ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` (only ``z``
is allowed to be 0) with a tolerance ``dimensions_tolerance_m`` that indicates,
how much the detected dimensions are allowed to deviate from the given dimensions. By default, a tolerance of 0.01 m is assumed.
Furthermore, a ``template_id`` must be given, which will be used to refer to the specified dimensions and the 
textures of the detected rectangles. Additionally, the maximum possible deformation of the items ``max_deformation_m``
can be given in meters (default 0.004 m), to account for rigid or more flexible objects.

If a ``template_id`` is used for the first time, BoxPick will run the detection of rectangles as for the item
model type ``RECTANGLE``, and use the given dimensions and tolerance to specify the dimensions range. If the z dimension
is given in addition to x and y, rectangles with all possible combinations of the three dimensions will be detected. From the detected
rectangles, so-called *views* are created, which contain the shape and the image intensity values of the rectangles,
and are stored in a newly created template with the given ``template_id``. The views are created iteratively: Starting
from the detected rectangle with the highest score, a view is created and then used to detect more rectangles with the same
texture. Then, all remaining clusters are used to detect further rectangles by the given dimensions range and again a view is
created from the best rectangle and used for further detections.
Each template can store up to 10 different views, for example corresponding to different types of the same product packaging.
Each view will be assigned a unique ID (``view_uuid``)
and all rectangle items with a matching texture will be assigned the same ``view_uuid``. That also means that all items
with the same ``view_uuid`` will have consistent orientations, because the orientation of each item is aligned with its texture.
The views can be displayed, deleted and the orientation of each view can be set via the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})` by clicking on the template or its edit symbol in the template list.
Each detected item contains a field ``view_pose_set`` indicating whether the orientation of the item's view was explicitly set or
is still unset at its original random state, which has a 180° ambiguity. Additionally, a user-defined name can be set for each view, that
is returned along with the ``view_uuid`` for all items and allows an easier identification of a specific view.
The ``type`` of a returned item with a ``view_uuid`` will be
``TEXTURED_RECTANGLE``.

If the template with the given ``template_id`` already exists, the existing views will be used to detect rectangles based on their
texture. If additional rectangles are found with matching dimensions, but different texture, new views will be generated and added
to the template. When the maximum number of views is reached, views that are matched only rarely will be deleted so that newly generated
views can be added to the template and the template is kept up-to-date. To prevent a template from being updated, automatic view updating 
can be disabled and enabled for 
each template in the |webgui| by clicking on the template or the edit symbol in the template list. 
The dimension tolerance and the maximum deformation can also be changed there for each template. The maximum deformation determines
the tolerance for the texture matching, representing possible shifts within the texture, e.g. caused by deformations of the object surface.
For rigid objects the ``max_deformation_m`` should be set to a low value in meters to ensure accurate matching.

The template's ``dimensions`` can only be specified when creating a new template. Once the template is generated, the dimensions cannot be changed
and do not need to be given in the detect request. If the dimensions are still given in the request, they must match the existing dimensions 
in the template. However, the ``dimensions_tolerance_m``
and ``max_deformation_m`` can be set differently in every detect request and their values will also be updated in the stored template.

.. _sect-boxpick-compute-grasps:

Computation of grasps
---------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; grasp
   single: BoxPick; grasp sorting

The BoxPick module offers a service for computing grasps for
suction grippers. The gripper is defined by its suction surface length and width.

The grasps are computed on the detected rectangular ``items``
(see :ref:`sect-boxpick-detect-items`:latex:`, Section \ref{boxpick:sect-boxpick-detect-items}`).

Optionally, further information can be given to the module in a grasp
computation request:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be grasped.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to compute grasps
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-compartment`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier_db:sect-loadcarrier-compartment}`).
- The ID of the 3D region of interest where to search for the load carriers if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the 3D region of interest where to compute grasps.
- Collision detection information: The ID of the gripper to enable collision checking and optionally
  a pre-grasp offset to define a pre-grasp position.
  Details on collision
  checking are given below in :ref:`sect-boxpick-collision-check-dep`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{boxpick:sect-boxpick-collision-check-dep})`.

A grasp provided by the BoxPick module represents the recommended
pose of the TCP (Tool Center Point) of the suction gripper.
The grasp ``type`` is always set to ``SUCTION``.
The computed grasp pose is the center of the biggest ellipse that can be inscribed in
each surface.
The grasp orientation is a right-handed coordinate system and is defined such
that its z axis is normal to the surface pointing inside the object at the grasp position and
its x axis is directed along the maximum elongation of the ellipse. Since the x axis can have two possible directions,
the one that better fits to the preferred TCP orientation (see :ref:`sect-boxpick-set-preferred-orientation`:latex:`,
Section \ref{boxpick:sect-boxpick-set-preferred-orientation}`) is selected. If the run-time parameter ``allow_any_grasp_z_rotation``
is set to true, the x axis will not be forced to be aligned with the maximum elongation of the graspable ellipse, but can have
any rotation around the z axis. In this case, the returned grasp will have the orientation that best fits to the preferred TCP orientation
and is collision free, if collision checking is enabled.

.. _fig-boxpick-grasp-surface:
.. figure:: images/boxpick_grasp_surface.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Illustration of a suction grasp with coordinate system and ellipse representing
   the maximum suction surface

Each grasp includes the dimensions of the maximum suction surface available,
modelled as an ellipse of axes ``max_suction_surface_length`` and
``max_suction_surface_width``. The user is enabled to filter grasps by specifying
the minimum suction surface required by the suction device in use.
If the run-time parameter ``allow_any_grasp_z_rotation``
is set to true, ``max_suction_surface_length`` and
``max_suction_surface_width`` will be equal and correspond to the shortest axis of the largest
graspable ellipse.

In the BoxPick module, the grasp position corresponds to the center of the detected
rectangle. When BoxPick is called with item models of type ``RECTANGLE``, the dimensions 
of the maximum suction surface available matches the estimated
rectangle dimensions. In this case, detected rectangles with missing data or occlusions by other objects for more
than 15% of their surface do not get an associated grasp.

When BoxPick is called with item models of type ``TEXTURED_BOX``, grasps can also be computed
on partly occluded boxes. The maximum suction surface available matches the free surface
that is not occluded by other clusters.

Each grasp also includes a ``quality`` value, which gives an
indication of the flatness of the grasping surface.
The ``quality`` value varies between 0 and 1, where higher numbers correspond to a
flatter reconstructed surface.

.. In case of multi-cup suction devices, the suction surface
.. is expected to cover all suction elements.

The grasp definition is complemented by a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier)
and the ``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to compute the grasp.

Grasp sorting is performed based on the selected sorting strategy. The following sorting strategies
are available and can be set in the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
or using the ``set_sorting_strategies`` service call:

- ``gravity``: highest grasp points along the gravity direction are returned first,
- ``surface_area``: grasp points with the largest surface area are returned first,
- ``direction``: grasp points with the shortest distance along a defined direction ``vector`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.
- ``distance_to_point``: grasp points with the shortest or farthest (if ``farthest_first`` is true) distance from a ``point`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.

If no sorting strategy is set or default sorting is chosen in the |webgui|, sorting is done based on a combination of
``gravity`` and ``surface_area``.


.. _sect-boxpick-set-preferred-orientation:

Setting the preferred orientation of the TCP
--------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; preferred orientation

The BoxPick module determines the reachability of grasp points based on the *preferred orientation* of the
TCP. The preferred orientation can be set via the ``set_preferred_orientation`` service or on
the BoxPick page in the |webgui|.
The resulting direction of the TCP's z axis is used to reject grasps which cannot be reached by the gripper.
Furthermore, the preferred orientation is used to select one grasp of several possible symmetries that is best reachable for the robot.

The preferred orientation can be set in the camera coordinate frame or in the external coordinate frame, in case
a hand-eye calibration is available. If the preferred orientation is specified in the external coordinate frame
and the sensor is robot mounted, the current robot pose has to be given to each object detection call.
If no preferred orientation is set, the orientation of the left camera
(see :ref:`rcvisard:sect-coordinate-frames` :cubeonly:`in the rc_visard manual`) will be used as the preferred orientation of the TCP.used.

.. _sect-boxpick-dependencies:

Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the BoxPick module depends on, and interacts with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the BoxPick module.

.. For each load carrier detection and grasp computation, the BoxPick module
.. acquires datasets of synchronized images and estimates the gravity vector.
.. The data acquisition step normally takes between 500 ms and 600 ms
.. with "High" depth image quality.

.. _sect-boxpick-stereo-camera-matching:

Camera and depth data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BoxPick module makes internally use of the following data:

- Rectified images from the :doc:`camera`
  (``rc_camera``:latex:`, Section \ref{camera:sect-camera}`)

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng or matrixvision

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`), in case a stereo camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`blaze`
     (``rc_blaze``:latex:`, Section \ref{blaze:sect-blaze}`), in case a Basler |blaze| camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and roboception

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`zivid`
     (``rc_zivid``:latex:`, Section \ref{zivid:sect-zivid}`), in case a |zivid| camera is used

All processed images are guaranteed to be captured after the module trigger time.

.. _sect-boxpick-iocontrol-dep:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and
the :doc:`iocontrol` module (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`),
it is recommended to connect the projector to GPIO Out 1 and set
the stereo-camera module's acquisition mode to ``SingleFrameOut1``
(see :ref:`Stereo matching parameters<sect-disp-image-parameters>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`), so that
on each image acquisition trigger an image with and without projector pattern is acquired.

Alternatively, the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set to ``ExposureAlternateActive``
(see :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params}`).

In either case,
the *Auto Exposure Mode* ``exp_auto_mode`` should be set to ``AdaptiveOut1`` to optimize the exposure
of both images.

.. _sect-boxpick-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the BoxPick module
can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the BoxPick node's :ref:`sect-boxpick-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{boxpick:sect-boxpick-services})`, the frame of the
output poses can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   This means that the configured regions of interest and load carriers move with the camera.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured poses
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.

If the sensor is robot-mounted, the current ``robot_pose`` has to be provided depending on the value of ``pose_frame``
and the definition of the sorting direction or sorting point:

- If ``pose_frame`` is set to ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the sorting direction is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the distance-to-point sorting strategy is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- In all other cases, providing the robot pose is optional.

.. _sect-boxpick-load-carrier-dep:

LoadCarrier
^^^^^^^^^^^

The BoxPick module uses the load carrier detection functionality provided by the
:doc:`loadcarrier` module (``rc_load_carrier``:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
with the run-time parameters specified for this module. However, only one load carrier will be
returned and used in case multiple matching load carriers could be found in the scene. In case multiple
load carriers of the same type are visible, a 3D region of interest should be set to ensure that always the
same load carrier is used for the BoxPick module.

The load carrier is used to filter false detections when BoxPick is triggered with an item model of type 
``TEXTURED_BOX`` and all three dimensions x, y, z are given. In this case, 3D boxes are created internally 
by adding the missing dimensions to the detected rectangles and only detections corresponding
to boxes which are fully inside the detected load carrier are returned.

.. _sect-boxpick-collision-check-dep:

CollisionCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collision checking can be easily enabled for
grasp computation of the BoxPick module by passing the ID of the used gripper and
optionally a pre-grasp offset to the
``compute_grasps`` service call. The gripper has to be
defined in the GripperDB module
(see :ref:`sect-gripper-db-gripper`:latex:`, Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripper-db-gripper}`)
and details about collision checking are given in :ref:`sect-collision-check-other-modules`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-other-modules})`.

If collision checking is enabled, only grasps which are collision free will be returned.
However, the visualization images on the *BoxPick*
page of the |webgui| also show colliding grasp points as black ellipses.

The CollisionCheck module's run-time parameters affect the collision detection as described in
:ref:`CollisionCheck Parameters<sect-collisioncheck-parameters>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

.. _expl-boxpick-manual-line-sensitivity:

``manual_line_sensitivity`` (*Manual Line Sensitivity*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    determines whether the user-defined line sensitivity should be used
    to extract the lines for rectangle detection. If this
    parameter is set to true, the user-defined ``line_sensitivity`` value
    will be used. If this parameter is set to false, automatic line sensitivity
    will be used. This parameter should be set to true when automatic line sensitivity
    does not give enough lines at the box boundaries so that boxes cannot be detected.
    The detected line segments are visualized in the "Intermediate Result" visualization on the
    |webgui|'s *BoxPick* page.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

.. _expl-boxpick-allow-any-grasp-z-rotation:

``allow_any_grasp_z_rotation`` (*Allow Any Grasp Z Rotation*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    If set to true, the returned grasps are no longer forced to have their x axes aligned with the maximum elongation of the graspable ellipse, but
    can have any rotation around the z axis. The returned ``max_suction_surface_length`` and ``max_suction_surface_width`` will be equal and 
    correspond to the shortest diameter of the largest graspable ellipse. This parameter enables the robot to get more options for grasping objects, 
    especially in scenes where collisions can occur. However, since the grasp is no longer aligned with the graspable ellipse, 
    the correct orientation for placing the object must be determined from the corresponding ``item``'s pose.

            Only one strategy may have a ``weight`` greater than 0. If all ``weight`` values are set to 0, the module will use the
            default sorting strategy.

            If the weight for ``direction`` is set, the
            ``vector`` must contain the direction vector and ``pose_frame`` must be either ``camera`` or ``external``.

            If the weight for ``distance_to_point`` is set, ``point`` must contain the sorting point and ``pose_frame`` must be either ``camera`` or ``external``.

.. _sect-boxpick-return-codes:

Return codes
------------

.. index::
   pair: BoxPick; return codes


Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.

The following table contains a list of common codes:

.. tabularcolumns:: |c|L|

    "-4",   "Data acquisition took longer than allowed"
    "-8",   "The template has been deleted during detection."
    "-10",  "New element could not be added as the maximum storage capacity of load carriers, regions of interest or template has been exceeded"
    "-11",  "Sensor not connected, not supported or not ready"
    "-200", "Fatal internal error"
    "-301", "More than one item model provided to the ``compute_grasps`` service"
    "10",   "The maximum storage capacity of load carriers, regions of interest or templates has been reached"
    "11",   "An existent persistent model was overwritten by the call to ``set_load_carrier`` or ``set_region_of_interest``"
    "100",  "The requested load carriers were not detected in the scene"
    "101",  "No valid surfaces or grasps were found in the scene"
    "102",  "The detected load carrier is empty"
