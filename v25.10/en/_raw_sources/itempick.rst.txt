Introduction
------------

.. Short description and functionalities

The |itempick| module provides an out-of-the-box perception solution for robotic pick-and-place
applications. ItemPick targets the detection of flat surfaces on unknown objects for picking
with a suction gripper. :cubeonly:`ItemPickAI uses neural networks to segment objects 
of a given object category and computes oriented and object-centered grasp points for suction grippers.`

In addition, the module offers:

- A dedicated page on the |rc_xxx| :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
  for easy setup, configuration, testing, and application tuning.
- The definition of regions of interest to select relevant volumes in the scene
  (see :ref:`sect-roi`:latex:`, Section \ref{roi:sect-roi}`).
- A load carrier detection functionality for bin-picking applications
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
  to provide grasps for items inside a bin only.
- The definition of compartments inside a load carrier to provide grasps
  for specific volumes of the bin only.
- Collision checking between the gripper and the load carrier and/or the point cloud.
- Support for static and robot-mounted cameras and
  optional integration with the :doc:`handeye_calibration`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})` module,
  to provide grasps in the user-configured external reference frame.
- A quality value associated to each suggested grasp and related to the flatness of the grasping surface.
- Selection of a sorting strategy to sort the returned grasps.
- 3D visualization of the detection results with grasp points and gripper animations in the |webgui|.

   .. note::

      This module is pipeline specific. Changes to its settings or parameters only affect
      the respective camera pipeline and have no influence on other pipelines running on the |rc_cube|.

.. Note::

  In this chapter, cluster and surface are used as synonyms and identify a set of
  points (or pixels) with defined geometrical properties.

The module is an optional on-board module of the |rc_xxx|
and requires a separate ItemPick :cubeonly:`or ItemPickAI` :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

Computation of grasps
---------------------

   .. index::

      single: ItemPickAI; grasp sorting

The |itempick| module offers a service for computing grasps for
suction grippers. The gripper is defined by its suction surface length and width.

The ItemPick module identifies flat surfaces in the scene and supports
flexible and/or deformable items. The ``type`` of these ``item_models`` is
called ``UNKNOWN`` since they don't need to have a standard geometrical shape.
Optionally, the user can also specify the minimum and maximum size of the item.

.. only:: rc_cube

   For ItemPickAI, the grasps are computed in the center of the top surface of the segmented objects (``items``)
   of the given object category. The object category is chosen by setting the ``type`` of ``item_models``. 
   Currently the types ``BAG`` and ``CONSUMER_GOODS`` are supported. ``BAG`` refers to deformable and flexible bag-like objects
   with various filling levels, such as pouch packs, packets, bulk bags, shipping bags, paper bags and sacks.
   ``CONSUMER_GOODS`` includes general packaged consumer products, such as packaged food, beverages, toiletries, cleaning supplies, 
   and other affordable household goods.

   .. Note::
      The first detection call with the ``BAG`` or ``CONSUMER_GOODS`` item model takes longer than the following detection calls,
      because the model has to be loaded into the ItemPickAI module first.
      
Optionally, further information can be given to the modules in a grasp
computation request:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be grasped.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to compute grasps
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-compartment`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier_db:sect-loadcarrier-compartment}`).
- The ID of the 3D region of interest where to search for the load carriers if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the 3D region of interest where to compute grasps.
- Collision detection information: The ID of the gripper to enable collision checking and optionally
  a pre-grasp offset to define a pre-grasp position.
  Details on collision
  checking are given below in :ref:`sect-itempick-collision-check-dep`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-collision-check-dep})`.

A grasp provided by the |itempick| module represents the recommended
pose of the TCP (Tool Center Point) of the suction gripper.
The grasp ``type`` is always set to ``SUCTION``.

For ItemPick with an ``UNKNOWN`` item model, the computed grasp pose is the center 
of the biggest ellipse that can be inscribed in each surface.

.. only:: rc_cube

   For ItemPickAI with the ``BAG`` or ``CONSUMER_GOODS`` item model, the grasp position corresponds to the center of the top surface of the segmented
   objects.

The grasp orientation is a right-handed coordinate system and is defined such
that its z axis is normal to the surface pointing inside the object at the grasp position and
its x axis is directed along the maximum elongation of the ellipse. Since the x axis can have two possible directions,
the one that better fits to the preferred TCP orientation (see :ref:`sect-itempick-set-preferred-orientation`:latex:`,
Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-set-preferred-orientation}`) is selected. If the run-time parameter ``allow_any_grasp_z_rotation``
is set to true, the x axis will not be forced to be aligned with the maximum elongation of the graspable ellipse, but can have
any rotation around the z axis. In this case, the returned grasp will have the orientation that best fits to the preferred TCP orientation
and is collision free, if collision checking.

.. _fig-itempick-grasp-surface:
.. figure:: images/itempick_grasp_surface.png
   :width: 300 px
   :align: center

   Illustration of a suction grasp with coordinate system and ellipse representing
   the maximum suction surface

Each grasp includes the dimensions of the maximum suction surface available,
modelled as an ellipse of axes ``max_suction_surface_length`` and
``max_suction_surface_width``. The user is enabled to filter grasps by specifying
the minimum suction surface required by the suction device in use. 
If the run-time parameter ``allow_any_grasp_z_rotation``
is set to true, ``max_suction_surface_length`` and
``max_suction_surface_width`` will be equal and correspond to the shortest axis of the largest
graspable ellipse.

Each grasp also includes a ``quality`` value, which gives an
indication of the flatness of the grasping surface.
The ``quality`` value varies between 0 and 1, where higher numbers correspond to a
flatter reconstructed surface.

.. In case of multi-cup suction devices, the suction surface
.. is expected to cover all suction elements.

The grasp definition is complemented by a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier)
and the ``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to compute the grasp.

Grasp sorting is performed based on the selected sorting strategy. The following sorting strategies
are available and can be set in the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
or using the ``set_sorting_strategies`` service call:

- ``gravity``: highest grasp points along the gravity direction are returned first,
- ``surface_area``: grasp points with the largest surface area are returned first,
- ``direction``: grasp points with the shortest distance along a defined direction ``vector`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.
- ``distance_to_point``: grasp points with the shortest or farthest (if ``farthest_first`` is true) distance from a ``point`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.

If no sorting strategy is set or default sorting is chosen in the |webgui|, sorting is done based on a combination of
``gravity`` and ``surface_area``.

.. _sect-itempick-set-preferred-orientation:

Setting the preferred orientation of the TCP
--------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: ItemPick; preferred orientation

.. only:: rc_cube

   .. index::
      single: ItemPickAI; preferred orientation

The |itempick| module determines the reachability of grasp points based on the *preferred orientation* of the
TCP. The preferred orientation can be set via the ``set_preferred_orientation`` service or on
the ItemPick :cubeonly:`or ItemPickAI` page in the |webgui|.
The resulting direction of the TCP's z axis is used to reject grasps which cannot be reached by the gripper.
Furthermore, the preferred orientation is used to select one grasp of several possible symmetries that is best reachable for the robot.

The preferred orientation can be set in the camera coordinate frame or in the external coordinate frame, in case
a hand-eye calibration is available. If the preferred orientation is specified in the external coordinate frame
and the sensor is robot mounted, the current robot pose has to be given to each object detection call.
If no preferred orientation is set, the orientation of the left camera 
(see :ref:`rcvisard:sect-coordinate-frames` :cubeonly:`in the rc_visard manual`) will be used as the preferred orientation of the TCP.


.. _sect-itempick-dependencies:

Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the |itempick| module depends on, and interacts with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the |itempick| module.

.. For each load carrier detection and grasp computation, the ItemPick module
.. acquires datasets of synchronized images and estimates the gravity vector.
.. The data acquisition step normally takes between 500 ms and 600 ms
.. with "High" depth image quality.

.. _sect-itempick-stereo-camera-matching:

Camera and depth data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |itempick| module makes internally use of the following data:

- Rectified images from the :doc:`camera`
  (``rc_camera``:latex:`, Section \ref{camera:sect-camera}`);

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng or matrixvision

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
     (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`), in case a stereo camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or basler or schunk)

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`blaze`
     (``rc_blaze``:latex:`, Section \ref{blaze:sect-blaze}`), in case a Basler |blaze| camera is used

.. only:: rc_cube and roboception

   - Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`zivid`
     (``rc_zivid``:latex:`, Section \ref{zivid:sect-zivid}`), in case a |zivid| camera is used

All processed images are guaranteed to be captured after the module trigger time.

.. _sect-itempick-iocontrol-dep:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and
the :doc:`iocontrol` module (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`),
it is recommended to connect the projector to GPIO Out 1 and set
the stereo-camera module's acquisition mode to ``SingleFrameOut1``
(see :ref:`Stereo matching parameters<sect-disp-image-parameters>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`), so that
on each image acquisition trigger an image with and without projector pattern is acquired.

Alternatively, the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set to ``ExposureAlternateActive``
(see :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params}`).

In either case,
the *Auto Exposure Mode* ``exp_auto_mode`` should be set to ``AdaptiveOut1`` to optimize the exposure
of both images.

.. _sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the |itempick| module
can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the |itempick| node's :ref:`sect-itempick-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-services})`, the frame of the
output poses can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   This means that the configured regions of interest and load carriers move with the camera.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured poses
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.

If the sensor is robot-mounted, the current ``robot_pose`` has to be provided depending on the value of ``pose_frame``
and the definition of the sorting direction or sorting point:

- If ``pose_frame`` is set to ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the sorting direction is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the distance-to-point sorting strategy is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- In all other cases, providing the robot pose is optional.

.. _sect-itempick-load-carrier-dep:

LoadCarrier
^^^^^^^^^^^

The |itempick| module uses the load carrier detection functionality provided by the
:doc:`loadcarrier` module (``rc_load_carrier``:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
with the run-time parameters specified for this module. However, only one load carrier will be
returned and used in case multiple matching load carriers could be found in the scene. In case multiple
load carriers of the same type are visible, a 3D region of interest should be set to ensure that always the
same load carrier is used for the |itempick| module.

.. _sect-itempick-collision-check-dep:

CollisionCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collision checking can be easily enabled for
grasp computation of the |itempick| module by passing the ID of the used gripper and
optionally a pre-grasp offset to the
``compute_grasps`` service call. The gripper has to be
defined in the GripperDB module
(see :ref:`sect-gripper-db-gripper`:latex:`, Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripper-db-gripper}`)
and details about collision checking are given in :ref:`sect-collision-check-other-modules`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-other-modules})`.

If collision checking is enabled, only grasps which are collision free will be returned.
However, the visualization images on the ItemPick :cubeonly:`or ItemPickAI`
page of the |webgui| also show colliding grasp points as black ellipses.

The CollisionCheck module's run-time parameters affect the collision detection as described in
:ref:`CollisionCheck Parameters<sect-collisioncheck-parameters>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

      If set to true, the grasps are no longer forced to be centered on the object and aligned with the major axis of the object, 
      but may be located anywhere on the object where graspable surfaces are found. For this, the segmented object surfaces are 
      clustered using the clustering parameters to find the graspable surfaces of an object. This parameter enables the robot 
      to get more options for grasping objects, especially 
      on concave objects or objects with surface discontinuities. This parameter has no effect when the ``UNKNOWN`` item model type is used.

      Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

    This parameter is only used when collision checking is enabled by passing a gripper to the ``compute_grasps`` service call.
    If ``check_collisions_with_point_cloud`` is set to true,
    all grasp points will be checked for collisions between the gripper and a watertight version of the point cloud, and only grasp points
    at which the gripper would not collide with this point cloud will be returned.

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.
