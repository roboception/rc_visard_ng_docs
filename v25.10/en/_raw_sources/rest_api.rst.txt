|rest-api| interface
--------------------

.. index::
   single: REST-API

The |rc_xxx| offers a comprehensive RESTful web
interface (|rest-api|) which any HTTP client or library can access.
Whereas most of the provided parameters, services, and functionalities can also
be accessed via the user-friendly :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\ (Section
\ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`, the |rest-api| serves rather as a
machine-to-machine interface to the |rc_xxx|, e.g., to programmatically

*  set and get run-time parameters of computation nodes, e.g., of cameras
   or image processing modules;
*  do service calls, e.g., to start and stop individual computational nodes,
   or to use offered services such as the hand-eye calibration;
*  read the current state of the system and individual computational nodes; or
*  update the |rc_xxx|'s firmware or license.


.. NOTE:: In the |rc_xxx|'s |rest-api|, a *node* is a computational component
            that bundles certain algorithmic functionality and offers a
            holistic interface (parameters, services, current status). Examples
            for such nodes are the stereo matching node or the hand-eye calibration node.
