Introduction
------------

The |silm| module is an optional on-board module of the |rc_xxx| and requires a separate |silm| :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

.. only:: rc_cube or rc_reason_stack

   .. note:: This module is not available in camera pipelines of type |rgbd_only|.

The module detects objects by matching a predefined silhouette (“template”) to edges in the image.

The |silm| module can detect objects in two different scenarios:

   **With calibrated base plane**: The objects are placed on a common base plane, which must be calibrated before the detection, and the objects have
   significant edges on a common plane that is parallel to the base plane.

   **With object plane detection**: The objects can be placed at different, previously unknown heights, if the objects have a planar surface and their outer
   contours are well visible in the images (e.g. stacked flat objects).

Templates for object detection can be created by uploading a DXF file and specifying the object height.
The correct scale and unit of the contours are extracted from the DXF file. If no units are
present in the DXF file, the user has to specify which units should be used. When the outer
contour of the object in the DXF file is closed, a 3D collision model is created automatically
by extruding the contour by the given object height. This model will then be used for collision checking
and in 3D visualizations.
Uploading a DXF file can be done in the |webgui| via the :guilabel:`+ Create a new Template` button in the
*SilhouetteMatch Templates and Grasps* section on the :menuselection:`Modules --> SilhouetteMatch` or
:menuselection:`Database --> Templates` pages.

   |manufacturer| also offers a template generation service on their
   `website <https://roboception.com/en/template-request/>`_:latex:`\:(\url{https://roboception.com/en/template-request/})`,
   where the user can upload CAD files or recorded data of the objects and request object templates for the |silm| module.

.. only:: schunk

   |company| also also offers a template generation service via mechatronics@de.schunk.com,
   where the user can send CAD files or recorded data of the objects and request object templates for the |silm| module.

.. only:: basler

   |manufacturer| also offers a template generation service,
   where the user can upload CAD files or recorded data of the objects and request object templates for the |silm| module.


The object templates consist of significant edges of each object. These template edges are matched to the
edges detected in the left and right camera images, considering the
actual size of the objects and their distance from the camera. The poses of the detected objects are
returned and can be used for grasping, for example.

The |silm| module offers:

- A dedicated page on the |rc_xxx| :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
  for easy setup, configuration, testing, and application tuning.
- A :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` and a
  :doc:`eki`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{eki:sect-eki})`.
- The definition of 2D regions of interest to select relevant parts of the camera image
  (see :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-roi`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-roi}`).
- A load carrier detection functionality for bin-picking applications
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
  to provide grasps for objects inside a bin only.
- Storing of up to 50 templates.
- The definition of up to 50 grasp points for each template via an interactive visualization in the |webgui|.
- Collision checking between the gripper and the load carrier, the calibrated base plane, other detected objects and/or the point cloud.
- Support for static and robot-mounted cameras and
  optional integration with the :doc:`handeye_calibration`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})` module,
  to provide grasps in the user-configured external reference frame.
- Selection of a sorting strategy to sort the detected objects and returned grasps.
- 3D visualization of the detection results with grasp points and gripper animations in the |webgui|.

   .. note::

      This module is pipeline specific. Changes to its settings or parameters only affect
      the respective camera pipeline and have no influence on other pipelines running on the |rc_xxx|.

      However, the object templates and grasp points are stored globally. Setting, changing
      or deleting an object template or its grasps affects all camera pipelines.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-suitable-objects:

Suitable objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |silm| module is intended for objects which have significant edges on a common plane that is
parallel to the plane on which the objects are placed. This applies to flat, nontransparent
objects, such as routed, laser-cut or water-cut 2D parts and flat-machined parts. More complex
parts can also be detected if there are significant edges on a common plane, e.g. a special
pattern printed on a flat surface.
The detection works best for objects on a texture-free plane. The color of the base plane should
be chosen such that a clear contrast between the objects and the base plane appears in the intensity image.

In case the objects are not placed on a common base plane or the base plane cannot be calibrated beforehand,
the objects need to have a planar surface and their outer contour must be well visible in the left and right images.
Furthermore, the template for these objects must have a closed outer contour.

Suitable scene
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scene must meet the following conditions to be suitable for the |silm| module:

- The objects to be detected must be suitable for the |silm| module as described above.
- Only objects belonging to one specific template are visible at a time (unmixed scenario). In case other objects are visible as well, a proper region of interest (ROI) must be set.
- In case a calibrated base plane is used: The offset between the base plane normal and the camera's line of sight does not exceed 10 degrees.
- In case the object planes are detected automatically: The offset between the object's planar surface normal and the camera's line of sight does not exceed 25 degrees.
- The objects are not partially or fully occluded.
- All visible objects are right side up (no flipped objects).
- The object edges to be matched are visible in both, left and right camera images.


.. _sect-silhouettematch-base-plane-calib:

Base-plane calibration
----------------------

.. index::
   pair: SilhouetteMatch; base-plane calibration
   pair: SilhouetteMatch; base-plane

In case all objects are placed on a common plane that is known beforehand,
a base-plane calibration should be performed before triggering a detection.
Thereby, the distance and angle of the plane on which the objects are
placed is measured and stored persistently on the |rc_xxx|.

Separating the detection of the base plane from the actual object detection
renders scenarios possible in which the base plane is temporarily occluded.
Moreover, it increases performance of the object detection for scenarios where
the base plane is fixed for a certain time; thus, it is not necessary
to continuously re-detect the base plane.

The base-plane calibration can be performed in three different ways,
which will be explained in more detail further down:

- AprilTag based
- Stereo based
- Manual

The base-plane calibration is successful if the normal vector of the estimated base plane is at most
10 degrees offset to the camera's line of sight. If the base-plane calibration
is successful, it will be stored persistently on the |rc_xxx| until it is removed or a new base-plane
calibration is performed.

.. Note::

   To avoid privacy issues, the image of the persistently stored base-plane calibration will
   appear blurred after rebooting the |rc_xxx|.

In scenarios where the base plane is not accessible for calibration, a plane parallel to the base plane can be calibrated.
Then an ``offset`` parameter can be used to shift the estimated plane onto the actual base plane where
the objects are placed. The ``offset`` parameter gives the distance in meters by which the estimated plane
is shifted towards the camera.

In the |restapi|, a plane is defined by a ``normal`` and a ``distance``.
``normal`` is a normalized 3-vector, specifying the normal of the plane.
The normal points away from the camera.
``distance`` represents the distance of the plane from the camera along the normal.
Normal and distance can also be interpreted as :math:`a`, :math:`b`, :math:`c`, and :math:`d` components
of the plane equation, respectively:

.. math::
   ax + by + cz + d = 0


AprilTag based base-plane calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AprilTag detection (ref. :doc:`tagdetect`:latex:`, Section \ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection}`)
is used to find AprilTags
in the scene and fit a plane through them. At least three AprilTags must be placed on the base
plane so that they are visible in the left and right camera images. The tags should be placed
such that they are spanning a triangle that is as large as possible. The larger the triangle,
the more accurate is the resulting base-plane estimate.
Use this method if the base plane is untextured and no external random dot projector is available.
This calibration mode is available via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
and the |rcxxx| |webgui|.

Stereo based base-plane calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 3D point cloud computed by the stereo matching module is used to fit a plane
through its 3D points.
Therefore, the region of interest (ROI) for this method must
be set such that only the relevant base plane is included.
The ``plane_preference`` parameter allows to select whether the plane closest to
or farthest from the camera should be used as base plane.
Selecting the closest plane can be used in scenarios where the base plane is
completely occluded by objects or not accessible for calibration.
Use this method if the base plane is well textured or you can
make use of a random dot projector to project texture on the base plane.
This calibration mode is available via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
and the |rcxxx| |webgui|.

Manual base-plane calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The base plane can be set manually if its parameters are known, e.g. from previous
calibrations. This calibration mode is only available via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
and not the |rcxxx| |webgui|.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-roi:

Setting a region of interest
----------------------------

.. index::
   single: SilhouetteMatch; region of interest

If objects are to be detected only in part of the camera’s field of view,
a 2D region of interest (ROI) can be set accordingly as described in
:ref:`sect-roi-definition`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{roi:sect-roi-definition})`.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-grasps:

Setting of grasp points
-----------------------

.. index::
   single: SilhouetteMatch; grasp points
   single: SilhouetteMatch; object template

To use |silm| directly in a robot application, up to 50 grasp points
can be defined for each template. A grasp point represents the desired position and orientation
of the robot's TCP (Tool Center Point) to grasp an object as shown in
:numref:`fig-silhouettematch-grasp-points`.

.. _fig-silhouettematch-grasp-points:
.. figure:: images/grasp_points_silm.*
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Definition of grasp points with respect to the robot's TCP

Each grasp consists of an ``id`` which must be
unique within all grasps for an object template, the ``template_id`` representing the template
to which the grasp should be attached, and the ``pose`` in the coordinate frame of the object template.
Grasp points can be set via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`,
or by using the interactive visualization in the |webgui|.
Furthermore, a ``priority`` (spanning -2 for very low to 2 for very high) can be assigned to a grasp.
Priorities can facilitate robot applications and shorten response times when the run-time parameter
``only_highest_priority_grasps`` is set to true. In this case collision checking concludes when
grasps with the highest possible priority have been found. Finally, different grasps can be associated with
different grippers by specifying a ``gripper_id``. These individual grippers are then used for collision checking
of the corresponding grasps instead of the gripper defined in the ``detect_object`` request. If no ``gripper_id`` is given, the gripper
defined in the ``detect_object`` request will be used for collision checking.

When a grasp is defined on a symmetric object, all grasps symmetric to the defined one
will automatically be considered in the |silm| module's ``detect_object`` service call. Symmetric grasps
for a given grasp point can be retrieved using the ``get_symmetric_grasps`` service call and visualized in the |webgui|.

Users can also define replications of grasps around a custom axis. These replications spawn multiple grasps and free users
from setting too many grasps manually. The replication origin is defined as a coordinate frame in the object's coordinate
frame and the x axis of the replication origin frame corresponds to the replication axis.
The grasp is replicated by rotating it around this x axis
starting from its original pose. The replication is done in steps of size ``step_x_deg`` degrees.
The range is defined by the minimal and maximal boundaries ``min_x_deg`` and ``max_x_deg``.
The minimal (maximal) boundary must be a non-positive (non-negative) number up to (minus) 180 degrees.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-grasps-webgui:

Setting grasp points in the |webgui|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |rc_xxx| |webgui| provides an intuitive and interactive way of defining grasp points for object templates.
In a first step, the object template has to be uploaded to the |rc_xxx|. This can be done
in the |webgui| in any pipeline under :menuselection:`Modules --> SilhouetteMatch`
by clicking on :guilabel:`+ Add a new Template` in the
*Templates and Grasps* section, or in :menuselection:`Database --> Templates` in the
*SilhouetteMatch Templates and Grasps* section. Once the
template upload is complete, a dialog with a 3D visualization of the object template is shown
for adding or editing grasp
points. The same dialog appears when editing an existing template. If the template contains a collision model or a visualization model,
this 3D model is visualized as well.

This dialog provides two ways for setting grasp points:

1. **Adding grasps manually**:
   By clicking on the :guilabel:`+` symbol, a new grasp is placed in the object origin. The
   grasp can be given a unique name which corresponds to its ID.
   The desired pose of the grasp can be entered in the fields for *Position* and *Roll/Pitch/Yaw* which are given
   in the coordinate frame of the object template represented by the long x, y and z axes in the visualization.
   The grasp point can be placed freely with respect to the object template - inside, outside or on the surface.
   The grasp point and its orientation are visualized in 3D for verification.

2. **Adding grasps interactively**:
   Grasp points can be added interactively by first clicking on the :guilabel:`Add Grasp` button
   in the upper right corner of the visualization and then clicking on the desired point on the object template visualization.
   If the 3D model is displayed, the grasps will be attached to the surface of the 3D model. Otherwise, the
   grasp is attached to the template surface. The grasp orientation is a right-handed coordinate system and
   is chosen such that its z axis is perpendicular to the surface pointing inside the template at
   the grasp position. The position and orientation in the object coordinate frame is displayed on the right.
   The position and orientation of the grasp can also be changed interactively.
   In case :guilabel:`Snap to surface` is disabled (default), the grasp can be translated and rotated freely in all three dimensions
   by clicking on :guilabel:`Move Grasp` in the visualization menu and then dragging the grasp along the
   appropriate axis to the desired position. The orientation of the grasp can also be changed by rotating the axis with the mouse.
   In case :guilabel:`Snap to surface` is enabled in the visualization, the grasp can only be moved along the
   model surface.

Users can also specify a grasp priority by changing the :guilabel:`Priority` slider. A dedicated gripper can be selected
in the :guilabel:`Gripper` drop down field.

By activating the :guilabel:`Replication` check box, users can replicate the
grasp around a custom axis. The replication axis and the resulting replicated grasps are visualized.
The position and orientation of the replication axis relative to the object coordinate frame can be adjusted
interactively by clicking on :guilabel:`Move Replication Axis` in the visualization menu and then dragging the axis
to the desired position and orientation.
The grasps are replicated within the specified rotation range at the selected rotation step size. Users can cycle through
a visualization of the replicated grasps by dragging the bar below :guilabel:`Cycle through n replicated grasps` in
the :guilabel:`View Options` section of the visualization menu. If a gripper is selected for the grasp or a gripper has
been chosen in the visualization menu, the gripper is also shown at the currently selected grasp.

If the object template has symmetries, the grasps which are symmetric to the defined grasps can be displayed along with
their replications (if defined) by enabling :guilabel:`... symmetries` in the :guilabel:`View Options` section of the visualization menu.
The user can also cycle through a visualization of the symmetric grasps by dragging the
bar below :guilabel:`Cycle through n symmetric grasps`.


.. _sect-silhouettematch-grasps-rest-api:

Setting grasp points via the |rest-api|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grasp points can be set via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
using the ``set_grasp`` or ``set_all_grasps`` services
(see :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-internal-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-internal-services}`).
A grasp consists of the ``template_id`` of the template
to which the grasp should be attached, an ``id`` uniquely identifying the grasp point and
the ``pose``. The pose is given in the coordinate frame of the object template and
consists of a ``position`` in meters and an ``orientation`` as quaternion.
A dedicated gripper can be specified through setting the ``gripper_id`` field. The
``priority`` is specified by an integer value, ranging from -2 for very low, to 2 for very high with a step size
of 1. The replication origin is defined as a transformation in the object's coordinate frame and the x axis
of the transformation corresponds to the replication axis. The
replication range is controlled by the ``min_x_deg`` and ``max_x_deg`` fields and the step size ``step_x_deg``.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-set-preferred-orientation:

Setting the preferred orientation of the TCP
--------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: SilhouetteMatch; preferred orientation

The |silm| module determines the reachability of grasp points based on the *preferred orientation* of the
TCP. The preferred orientation can be set via the ``set_preferred_orientation`` service or on
the *SilhouetteMatch* page in the |webgui|.
The resulting direction of the TCP's z axis is used to reject grasps which cannot be reached by the gripper.
Furthermore, the preferred orientation can be used to sort the reachable grasps by setting the corresponding
sorting strategy.

The preferred orientation can be set in the camera coordinate frame or in the external coordinate frame, in case
a hand-eye calibration is available. If the preferred orientation is specified in the external coordinate frame
and the sensor is robot mounted, the current robot pose has to be given to each object detection call.
If no preferred orientation is set, the orientation of the left camera 
(see :ref:`rcvisard:sect-coordinate-frames` :cubeonly:`in the rc_visard manual`) will be used as the preferred orientation of the TCP.


.. _sect-silhouettematch-set-sorting-strategies:

Setting the sorting strategies
------------------------------

The objects and grasps returned by the ``detect_object`` service call are sorted according to a sorting strategy which can be
chosen by the user. The following sorting strategies are available and
can be set in the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
or using the ``set_sorting_strategies`` service call:

- ``preferred_orientation``: matches and grasp points with minimal rotation difference of a chosen ``axis`` (or all axes, when ``axis`` is empty) with respect to the preferred TCP orientation are returned first,
- ``direction``: objects and grasp points with the shortest distance along a defined direction ``vector`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.
- ``distance_to_point``: objects and grasp points with the shortest or farthest (if ``farthest_first`` is true) distance from a ``point`` in a given ``pose_frame`` are returned first.

If no sorting strategy is set or default sorting is chosen in the Web GUI, sorting is done based on a combination of
``preferred_orientation`` and the minimal distance from the camera along the z axis of the preferred orientation of the TCP.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-detect:

Detection of objects
--------------------

.. index::
   single: SilhouetteMatch; detection of objects
   single: SilhouetteMatch; sorting

For triggering the object detection, in general, the following information
must be provided to the |silm| module:

- The template of the object to be detected in the scene.
- The coordinate frame in which the poses of the detected objects shall be returned
  (ref. :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-hand-eye-calib`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-hand-eye-calib}`).

Optionally, further information can be given to the |silm| module:

- A flag ``object_plane_detection`` determining whether the surface plane of the objects should be used for the detection instead of the calibrated base plane.
- An offset, in case the calibrated base plane should be used but the objects are not lying on this plane but on a plane parallel
  to it. The offset is the distance between both planes
  given in the direction towards the camera. If omitted, an offset of 0 is assumed. It must not be set if ``object_plane_detection`` is true.
- The ID of the load carrier which contains the objects to be detected.
- The ID of the region of interest where to search for the load carrier if a
  load carrier is set. Otherwise, the ID of the region of interest where the objects should
  be detected. If omitted, objects are matched in the whole image.
- The current robot pose in case the camera is mounted on the robot and
  the chosen coordinate frame for the poses is ``external`` or the preferred orientation
  is given in the external frame.
- Collision detection information: The ID of the gripper to enable collision checking and optionally
  a pre-grasp offset to define a pre-grasp position.
  Details on collision
  checking are given below in
  :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-collision-check-dep`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-collision-check-dep})`.

In case the ``object_plane_detection`` flag is not true,
objects can only be detected after a successful base-plane calibration.
It must be ensured that the position and orientation of the base plane
does not change before the detection of objects.
Otherwise, the base-plane calibration must be renewed.

When ``object_plane_detection`` is set to true, a base-plane calibration is not required and
an existing base-plane calibration will be ignored. During detection, the scene is clustered into
planar surfaces and template matching is performed on each plane whose tilt with respect to the
camera's line of sight is less than 25° and whose size is large enough to contain the selected template.
When a match is found, its position and orientation are refined using the image edges and the
point cloud inside the template's outer contour. For this, it is required that the outer contour of
the template is closed and that the object's surface is planar.

On the |webgui| the detection can be tested in the *Try Out* section of the |silm| page.
Different image streams can be selected to show intermediate results and the final matches.

   The **"Template"** image stream shows the template
   to be matched in green with the defined grasp points in green
   (see :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-grasps`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-grasps}`).
   The template is warped to the size and tilt matching
   objects on the calibrated base plane or, in case ``object_plane_detection`` was used,
   the highest segmented plane, would have. The corresponding plane is shown in dark blue.

   The **"Intermediate Result"** image stream shows the edges of the left image that were used to search for matches in light blue.
   The chosen region of interest is shown as bold petrol rectangle.
   A shaded blue area on the left visualizes the region of the left camera image which does not overlap with
   the right image, and in which no objects can be detected. If ``object_plane_detection`` was used, this
   image stream also shows the detected planar clusters in the scene. Clusters that were
   not used for matching, because they were too small or too tilted, are visualized with a stripe pattern.

   The **"Intermediate Result Right"** image stream shows the edges of the right image that were used to search for matches in light blue.
   The chosen region of interest is shown as bold petrol rectangle.
   A shaded blue area on the right visualizes the region of the right camera image which does not overlap with
   the left image, and in which no objects can be detected.

   The **"Result"** image shows the detection result. The image edges
   that were used to refine the match poses are shown in light blue and the matches (``instances``)
   with the template edges are shown in green. The blue circles are the origins of the detected
   objects as defined in the template and the green circles are the
   collision-free grasp points. Colliding grasp points are visualized as
   red dots and grasp points that were not checked for collisions are drawn in yellow.

.. .. _fig-silm-stream-images:

..     "Template", "Intermediate Result" and "Result" image streams of the |silm| module as shown in the |webgui|
..     for a detection with ``object_plane_detection`` set to true

The poses of the object origins in the chosen
coordinate frame are returned as results in a list of ``instances``.
In case the calibrated base plane was used for the detection (``object_plane_detection`` not set or false),
the orientations of the detected objects are aligned with the normal of the base plane.
Otherwise, the orientations of the detected objects are aligned with the normal of a plane fitted to the
object points in the 3D point cloud.

If the chosen template also has grasp points attached,
a list of ``grasps`` for all objects is returned in addition to the list of detected objects.
The grasp poses are given in the desired coordinate frame and
the grasps are sorted according to the selected sorting strategy
(see :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-set-sorting-strategies`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-set-sorting-strategies}`).
There are references between the detected object instances and the grasps via their ``uuids``.

In case the templates have a continuous rotational symmetry (e.g. cylindrical objects),
all returned object poses will have the same orientation. Furthermore, all grasps symmetric
to each grasp point on an object are checked for reachability and collisions, and only the
best one according to the given sorting strategy is returned.

For objects with a discrete symmetry (e.g. prismatic objects), all collision-free symmetries of
each grasp point which are reachable according to the given preferred
TCP orientation are returned, ordered by the given sorting strategy.

The detection results and run times are affected by several run-time parameters which are listed
and explained further down. Improper parameters can lead to timeouts of the |silm| module's
detection process.


Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the |silm| module depends on, and interacts with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the |silm| module.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-stereo-camera-matching:

Camera and depth data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |silm| module makes internally use of the rectified images from the
:doc:`camera` (``rc_camera``:latex:`, Section \ref{camera:sect-camera}`).
Thus, the exposure time should be set properly to achieve the optimal performance of the module.

For base-plane calibration in stereo mode, for load carrier detection, for automatic object plane detection and for collision checking
with the point cloud, the disparity images from the :doc:`stereo_matching`
(``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`) are used.

For detecting objects with a calibrated base plane, without load carrier and without collision checking with the point cloud,
the stereo-matching module should not be run in parallel to the |silm| module, because the detection runtime increases.

For best results it is recommended to enable
:ref:`smoothing<expl-depth-smooth>` :latex:`(Section \ref{stereo_matching:expl-depth-smooth})`
for :doc:`stereo_matching`.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-iocontrol:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and
the :doc:`iocontrol` module (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`),
the projector should be used for the stereo-based base-plane calibration, for automatic object plane detection and for collision checking
with the point cloud.

The projected pattern must not be visible in the left and right camera images during object detection
as it interferes with the matching process.
Therefore, it is recommended to connect the projector to GPIO Out 1 and set
the stereo-camera module's acquisition mode to ``SingleFrameOut1``
(see :ref:`Stereo matching parameters<sect-disp-image-parameters>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`), so that
on each image acquisition trigger an image with and without projector pattern is acquired.

Alternatively, the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set to ``ExposureAlternateActive``
(see :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params}`).

In either case,
the *Auto Exposure Mode* ``exp_auto_mode`` should be set to ``AdaptiveOut1`` to optimize the exposure
of both images.


.. _sect-silhouettematch-hand-eye-calib:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the |silm| module can automatically provide
poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the |silm| node's :ref:`sect-silhouettematch-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch-services})`, the frame of the
input and output poses and plane coordinates can be controlled with the ``pose_frame``
argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses and plane coordinates provided to and by the module are in the camera frame.

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses and plane coordinates provided to and by the module are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the camera mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the sensor mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

.. Note::
   If the hand-eye calibration has changed after base-plane calibration,
   the base-plane calibration will be marked as invalid and must be renewed.

If the sensor is robot-mounted, the current ``robot_pose`` has to be provided depending on the value of ``pose_frame``,
the definition of the preferred TCP orientation and the sorting direction or sorting point:

- If ``pose_frame`` is set to ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the preferred TCP orientation is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the sorting direction is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- If the distance-to-point sorting strategy is defined in ``external``, providing the robot pose is obligatory.
- In all other cases, providing the robot pose is optional.

If the current robot pose is provided during calibration, it is stored persistently on the |rcxxx|.
If the updated robot pose is later provided during ``get_base_plane_calibration`` or ``detect_object``
as well, the base-plane calibration will be transformed automatically to this new robot pose.
This enables the user to change the robot pose (and thus camera position)
between base-plane calibration and object detection.

.. Note::
   Object detection can only be performed if the limit of 10 degrees angle offset between
   the base plane normal and the camera's line of sight is not exceeded.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-load-carrier-dep:

LoadCarrier
^^^^^^^^^^^

The |silm| module uses the load carrier detection functionality provided by the
:doc:`loadcarrier` module (``rc_load_carrier``:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
with the run-time parameters specified for this module. However, only one load carrier will be
returned and used in case multiple matching load carriers could be found in the scene. In case multiple
load carriers of the same type are visible, a region of interest should be set to ensure that always the
same load carrier is used for the |silm| module.

.. _sect-silhouettematch-collision-check-dep:

CollisionCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: SilhouetteMatch; collision check

Collision checking can be easily enabled for
grasp computation of the |silm| module by passing a ``collision_detection`` argument to the
``detect_object`` service call. It contains the ID of the used gripper and
optionally a pre-grasp offset. The gripper has to be
defined in the GripperDB module
(see :ref:`sect-gripper-db-gripper`:latex:`, Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripper-db-gripper}`)
and details about collision checking are given in :ref:`sect-collision-check-other-modules`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-other-modules})`. 

Alternatively, grasp points can be assigned individual gripper IDs, and collision checking can be enabled for all
grasp points with gripper IDs by enabling the run-time parameter ``check_collisions``.

In addition to collision checking between the gripper and the detected load carrier, collisions
between the gripper and the calibrated base plane will be checked, if the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_with_base_plane`` is true.
If the selected |silm| template contains a collision model and the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_with_matches`` is true,
also collisions between the gripper and all other detected objects (not limited to ``max_number_of_detected_objects``) will be checked. The object
on which the grasp point to be checked is located, is excluded from the collision check.

If the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_with_point_cloud`` is true,
also collisions between the gripper and a watertight version of the point cloud are checked.
If this feature is used with suctions grippers, it should be ensured that the TCP is defined
to be outside the gripper geometry, or that the grasp points are defined above the object surface.
Otherwise every grasp will result in a collision between the gripper and the point cloud.

If the run-time parameter ``check_collisions_during_retraction`` is true and a load carrier and a pre-grasp offset are given,
each grasp point will be checked for collisions between the object in the gripper and the load carrier walls during retraction.
This collision check is performed along the full linear trajectory from the grasp point back to the pre-grasp position.

If collision checking is enabled, only grasps which are collision free or could not be checked for collisions
(e.g. because no gripper was given) will be returned.
The visualization images on the *SilhouetteMatch* page of the |webgui| shows collision-free grasps in green, 
unchecked grasps in yellow and colliding grasp points in red. The detected objects which are considered in the collision check are
also visualized with their edges in green.

The CollisionCheck module's run-time parameters affect the collision detection as described in
:ref:`CollisionCheck Parameters<sect-collisioncheck-parameters>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

.. _expl-silhouettematch-max-objects:

``max_number_of_detected_objects`` (*Maximum Object Number*)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter gives the maximum number of objects to detect in the scene. If more than

.. _expl-silhouettematch-quality:

``quality`` (*Quality*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''
    Object detection can be performed on images with different resolutions:
    ``High`` (full image resolution), ``Medium`` (half image resolution) and
    ``Low`` (quarter image resolution). The lower
    the resolution, the lower the detection time, but the fewer details of the objects
    are visible.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

.. _expl-silhouettematch-max-distance:

``match_max_distance`` (*Maximum Matching Distance*)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter gives the maximum allowed pixel distance of an image edge pixel from the object
    edge pixel in the template to be still considered as matching. If the object is not perfectly
    represented in the template, it might not be detected when this parameter is low. High values,
    however, might lead to false detections in case of a cluttered scene or the presence of similar
    objects, and also increase runtime.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

.. _expl-silhouettematch-match-percentile:

``match_percentile`` (*Matching Percentile*)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter indicates how strict the matching process should be. The matching percentile is
    the ratio of template pixels that must be within the Maximum Matching Distance to successfully match the template.
    The higher this number, the more accurate the match must be to be considered as valid.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

.. _expl-silhouettematch-edge-sensitivity:

``edge_sensitivity`` (*Edge Sensitivity*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter influences how many edges are detected in the left and right camera images. The higher this number, the
    more edges are found in the intensity images. That means, for lower numbers, only the most significant edges
    are considered for template matching. A large number of edges in the image might increase the detection time.
    It must be ensured that the edges of the objects to be detected are detected in both, the left and the right camera images.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

.. _expl-silhouettematch-only-highest-priority-grasps:

``only_highest_priority_grasps`` (*Only Highest Priority Grasps*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   If set to true, only grasps with the highest priority will be returned. If collision checking is enabled, only the collision-free
   grasps among the group of grasps with the highest priority are returned.
   This can save computation time and reduce the number of grasps to be parsed on the application side.

   Without collision checking, only grasps of highest priority are returned.

.. _expl-silhouettematch-check-collisions:

``check_collisions`` (*Check Collisions*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    If this parameter is enabled, collision checking will be performed for all grasps which have a gripper ID assigned,
    even when no default gripper is given in the ``detect_object`` service call. If a load carrier is used, the collision 
    check will always be performed between the gripper and the load carrier. 
    Collision checking with the point cloud and other matches is only performed when the corresponding runtime parameters are enabled.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

``check_collisions_with_base_plane`` (*Check Collisions with Base Plane*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter is only used when collision checking is enabled by passing a gripper to the ``detect_object`` service call
    or by enabling the ``check_collisions`` runtime parameter.
    If ``check_collisions_with_base_plane`` is set to true,
    all grasp points will be checked for collisions between the gripper and the
    calibrated base plane, and only grasp points at which the gripper would not collide with the base plane will be
    returned.

``check_collisions_with_matches`` (*Check Collisions with Matches*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter is only used when collision checking is enabled by passing a gripper to the ``detect_object`` service call
    or by enabling the ``check_collisions`` runtime parameter.
    If ``check_collisions_with_matches`` is set to true, all grasp points will be checked for collisions between the gripper and 
    all other detected objects (not limited to
    ``max_number_of_detected_objects``), and only grasp points at which the gripper would not collide with any other detected object
    will be returned.

``check_collisions_with_point_cloud`` (*Check Collisions with Point Cloud*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter is only used when collision checking is enabled by passing a gripper to the ``detect_object`` service call
    or by enabling the ``check_collisions`` runtime parameter.
    If ``check_collisions_with_point_cloud`` set to true, all grasp points will be checked for 
    collisions between the gripper and a watertight version of the point cloud, and only grasp points
    at which the gripper would not collide with this point cloud will be returned.

``point_cloud_enhancement`` (*Enhance with Base Plane*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    This parameter is only considered when ``check_collisions_with_point_cloud`` is true and the object detection was
    triggered without ``object_plane_detection``. By default, ``point_cloud_enhancement`` is set to ``Off`` (*Off*).
    If ``point_cloud_enhancement`` is set to ``ReplaceBright`` (*Replace Bright Image Pixels*), the calibrated base plane will
    be used to enhance the point cloud that is used for collision checking. For this, the depth values of all bright image pixels inside the image or,
    if set, the 2D region of interest will be set to the depth of the calibrated base plane. This parameter should be used when dark objects are placed on an
    untextured bright background, e.g. on a light table.

    When ``check_collisions_during_retraction`` is enabled and a load carrier and a pre-grasp offset are given,
    each grasp point will be checked for collisions

         .. tab:: **Response**

            The first grasp in the returned list is the one that was passed with the service call.
            If the object template does not have an exact symmetry, only the grasp passed with the
            service call will be returned. If the object template has a continuous symmetry (e.g. a
            cylindrical object), only 12 equally spaced sample grasps will be returned.

Return codes
------------

.. index::
   pair: SilhouetteMatch; return codes

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
