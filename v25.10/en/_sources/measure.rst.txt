Measure

Introduction

The Measure module allows measuring of depth values in a specific
region of interest.

The Measure module is a base module which is available on every

rc_visard NG

.

Measuring Depth

The Measure module provides functionality to measure depth values in
the current scene in a 2D region of interest. Optionally, the region
of interest can be subdivided into up to 100 cells, for which separate
depth measurements are returned in addition to the overall depth
measurements of the whole region.

A depth measurement consist of the average depth "mean_z", the minimum
depth "min_z" and the maximum depth "max_z", each containing 3D
coordinates. The coordinates of the "min_z" and "max_z" measurements
correspond to the point in the cell or overall region with the minimum
and maximum distance from the camera, respectively. The "x" and "y"
coordinates of the "mean_z" measurements define a point in the center
of the cell or the overall region and the "z" coordinate is determined
by the average of all depth value measurements (distances from the
camera) in this region. Additionally, a "coverage" value is returned
for each cell and the overall region, which is a number between 0 and
1 that reflects the fraction of valid depth values inside the
respective region. A coverage value of 0 means that the cell is
invalid and no depth value could be computed.

When the external "pose_frame" is used for the depth measurements, all
3D coordinates are computed as described above, but then transformed
to the external frame. That means, the depth is always measured along
the line of sight of the camera, independently of the chosen pose
frame.

Interaction with other modules

Internally, the Measure module depends on, and interacts with other
on-board modules as listed below.

Note: All changes and configuration updates to these modules will
  affect the performance of the Measure module.

Depth Images

The Measure module internally makes use of the following data:

Disparity images from the Stereo matching module (rc_stereomatching,
Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching})

Hand-eye calibration

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the Measure module
can automatically provide points in the robot coordinate frame. For
the Measure node's

Services

, the frame of the output points can be controlled with the
"pose_frame" argument.

Two different "pose_frame" values can be chosen:

Camera frame (camera). All points provided by the module are in the
camera frame, and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in
the environment is required. It is the user's responsibility to update
the configured points if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-
mounted camera).

External frame (external). All points provided by the module are in
the external frame, configured by the user during the hand-eye
calibration process. The module relies on the on-board Hand-eye
calibration module\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-
calibration}) to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot
mounted) and the hand-eye transformation. If the mounting is static,
no further information is needed. If the sensor is robot-mounted, the
robot_pose is required to transform poses to and from the external
frame.

Note: If no hand-eye calibration is available, all "pose_frame"
  values should be set to "camera".

All "pose_frame" values that are not "camera" or "external" are
rejected.

Services

The user can explore and call the Measure module's services, e.g. for
development and testing, using the

REST-API interface

 or the

rc_visard NG


Web GUI

 on the

 page under

Modules

.

The Measure module offers the following services.

measure_depth

   Computes the mean, minimum and maximum depth in a given region of
   interest, which can optionally be subdivided into cells.

   Details

   This service can be called as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/0/nodes/rc_measure/services/measure_depth

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_measure/services/measure_depth

   Request

   Required arguments:

      "pose_frame": see

      Hand-eye calibration

      .

   Optional arguments:

      "region_of_interest_2d_id" is the ID of the 2D region of
      interest (see

      RoiDB

      ) that will be used for the depth measurements.

      "region_of_interest_2d" is an alternative on-the-fly definition
      of the region of interest for the depth measurements. This
      region of interest will be ignored if a
      "region_of_interest_2d_id" is given. The region of interest is
      always defined on the camera image with full resolution, where
      "offset_x" and "offset_y" are the pixel coordinates of the upper
      left corner of the rectangular region of interest, and "width"
      and "height" are the width and height of it in pixels. Default
      is a region of interest covering the whole image.

      "cell_count" is the number of cells in x and y direction into
      which the region of interest is divided. If not given, a cell
      count of 0, 0 is assumed and only the overall values will be
      computed. The total cell count is computed as product of the x
      and y values must not exceed 100.

      "data_acquisition_mode": if set to "CAPTURE_NEW" (default), a
      new image dataset will be used for the measurement. If set to
      "USE_LAST", the previous dataset will be used for the
      measurement.

   Potentially required arguments:

      "robot_pose": see

      Hand-eye calibration

      .

   The definition for the request arguments with corresponding
   datatypes is:

Return codes

Each service response contains a "return_code", which consists of a
"value" plus an optional "message". A successful service returns with
a "return_code" value of "0". Negative "return_code" values indicate
that the service failed. Positive "return_code" values indicate that
the service succeeded with additional information. The smaller value
is selected in case a service has multiple "return_code" values, but
all messages are appended in the "return_code" message.

The following table contains a list of common codes:
