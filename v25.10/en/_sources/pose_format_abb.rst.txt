ABB pose format

ABB robots use a position X, Y, Z and a quaternion Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 for
describing a pose, similar to

 devices. However, the position must be given in millimeters and the
quaternion order is as follows:

q=(\begin{array}{cccc}x & y & z & w\end{array}) =
(\begin{array}{cccc}Q2 & Q3 & Q4 & Q1\end{array}).
