REST-API interface

The

rc_visard NG

 offers a comprehensive RESTful web interface (REST-API) which any
HTTP client or library can access. Whereas most of the provided
parameters, services, and functionalities can also be accessed via the
user-friendly

Web GUI

, the REST-API serves rather as a machine-to-machine interface to the

rc_visard NG

, e.g., to programmatically

set and get run-time parameters of computation nodes, e.g., of cameras
or image processing modules;

do service calls, e.g., to start and stop individual computational
nodes, or to use offered services such as the hand-eye calibration;

read the current state of the system and individual computational
nodes; or

update the rc_visard NG's firmware or license.

Note: In the

  rc_visard NG

  's REST-API, a

  node

   is a computational component that bundles certain algorithmic
  functionality and offers a holistic interface (parameters, services,
  current status). Examples for such nodes are the stereo matching
  node or the hand-eye calibration node.
