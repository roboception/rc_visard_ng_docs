Description of run-time parameters

Each run-time parameter is represented by a row on the Web GUI's

Camera

 page. The name in the Web GUI is given in brackets behind the
parameter name and the parameters are listed in the order they appear
in the Web GUI.

acquisition_mode (Acquisition Mode)

   This values determines the camera acquisition mode. In "Continuous"
   mode, the camera will acquire images at the specified frame rate
   "fps". In "Trigger" mode, images are only acquired when the camera
   receives a trigger signal.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/0/nodes/rc_camera/services/parameters?acquisition_mode=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?acquisition_mode=<value>

trigger_source (Trigger Source)

   This value is only used when "acquisition_mode" is set to "Trigger"
   and determines the source for the trigger. In "Software" mode a
   trigger can be sent via the "rc_camera/acquisition_trigger"
   service. When the "acquisition_mode" for the depth images is set to
   "SingleFrame" or "SingleFrameOut1" (see

   Parameters

   ), the camera software trigger is sent automatically whenever a
   depth image acquisition is triggered. The modes "In1" and "In2" are
   hardware trigger modes. An image is acquired whenever a signal on
   the chosen input is received.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/0/nodes/rc_camera/services/parameters?trigger_source=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?trigger_source=<value>

trigger_activation (Trigger Activation)

   This value is only used when "acquisition_mode" is set to "Trigger"
   and "trigger_source" is set to "In1" or "In2". It determines the
   signal edge that should be used to trigger an acquisition. Possible
   values are "RisingEdge", "FallingEdge" or "AnyEdge".

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/0/nodes/rc_camera/services/parameters?trigger_activation=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?trigger_activation=<value>

fps (FPS (Hz))

   This value is the cameras' frame rate (fps, frames per second),
   which determines the upper frequency at which depth images can be
   computed. This is also the frequency at which the

   rc_visard NG

    delivers images via GigE Vision. Reducing this frequency also
   reduces the network bandwidth required to transmit the images.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?fps=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?fps=<value>

gamma (Gamma)

   The gamma value determines the mapping of perceived light to the
   brightness of a pixel. A gamma value of 1 corresponds to a linear
   relationship. Lower gamma values let dark image parts appear
   brighter. A value around 0.5 corresponds to human vision.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?gamma=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?gamma=<value>

contrast_mode (Contrast Mode)

   The contrast mode can be set to "Linear" (

   Linear

   ) or "SCurve" (

   S-Curve

   ) and determines how the image intensity values are scaled when the
   contrast is adjusted. In the "Linear" mode, the camera uses a
   linear function to adjust the contrast. Increasing or decreasing
   the contrast, increases or decreases the gradient of the linear
   function. When increasing the contrast, the darkest and lightest
   regions of the image will appear completely black or completely
   white, but the other areas will appear more defined. Decreasing the
   contrast has the opposite effect. In the "SCurve" mode, the camera
   uses an S-curve function to adjust the contrast. Increasing the
   contrast darkens dark pixels and lightens light pixels, but the
   dynamic range of the image is preserved.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?contrast_mode=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?contrast_mode=<value>

contrast (Contrast)

   Adjusting the contrast increases or decreases the difference
   between light and dark areas in the image. The way the light and
   dark regions change when adjusting the contrast depends on the
   specified "contrast_mode".

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?contrast=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?contrast=<value>

exp_control (Exposure Auto, HDR or Manual)

   The exposure control mode can be set to *Auto*, *HDR* or *Manual*.

   *Auto*: This is the default mode in which the exposure time and
   gain factor is chosen automatically to correctly expose the image.
   The last automatically determined exposure and gain values are set
   into "exp_value" and "gain_value" when switching auto-exposure off.

   *HDR*: The HDR mode computes high-dynamic-range images by combining
   images with different exposure times to avoid under-exposed and
   over-exposed areas. This decreases the frame rate and is only
   suitable for static scenes.

   *Manual*: In the manual exposure mode the exposure time and gain
   are kept fixed independent of the resulting image brightness.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_control=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_control=<value>

exp_auto_mode (Auto Exposure Mode)

   The auto exposure mode can be set to *Normal*, *Out1High* or
   *AdaptiveOut1*. These modes are relevant when the

   rc_visard NG

    is used with an external light source or projector connected to
   the camera's GPIO Out1, which can be controlled by the IOControl
   module (

   IO and Projector Control

   ).

   *Normal*: All images are considered for exposure control, except if
   the IOControl mode for GPIO Out1 is *ExposureAlternateActive*: then
   only images where GPIO Out1 is HIGH will be considered, since these
   images may be brighter in case GPIO Out1 is used to trigger an
   external light source.

   *Out1High*: This exposure mode adapts the exposure time using only
   images with GPIO Out1 HIGH. Images where GPIO Out1 is LOW are not
   considered at all, which means, that the exposure time does not
   change when only images with Out1 LOW are acquired. This mode is
   recommended for using the "acquisition_mode" "SingleFrameOut1" in
   the stereo matching module as described in

   Stereo Matching Parameters

    and having an external projector connected to GPIO Out1, when
   changes in the brightness of the scene should only be considered
   when Out1 is HIGH. This is the case, for example, when a bright
   part of the robot moves through the field of view of the camera
   just before a detection is triggered, which should not affect the
   exposure time.

   *AdaptiveOut1*: This exposure mode uses all camera images and
   tracks the exposure difference between images with GPIO Out1 LOW
   and HIGH. While the IOControl mode for GPIO Out1 is LOW, the images
   are under-exposed by this exposure difference to avoid over-
   exposure for when GPIO Out1 triggers an external projector. The
   resulting exposure difference is given as

   Out1 Reduction

    below the live images. This mode is recommended for using the
   "acquisition_mode" "SingleFrameOut1" in the stereo matching module
   as described in

   Stereo Matching Parameters

    and having an external projector connected to GPIO Out1, when
   changes in the brightness of the scene should be considered at all
   times. This is the case, for example, in applications where the
   external lighting changes.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_auto_mode=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_auto_mode=<value>

exp_max (Max Exposure)

   This value is the maximal exposure time in auto-exposure mode in
   seconds. The actual exposure time is adjusted automatically so that
   the images are exposed correctly. If the maximum exposure time is
   reached, but the images are still underexposed, the

   rc_visard NG

    stepwise increases the gain to increase the images' brightness.
   Limiting the exposure time is useful for avoiding or reducing
   motion blur during fast movements. However, higher gain introduces
   noise into the image. The best trade-off depends on the
   application.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_max=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_max=<value>

exp_auto_average_max (Max Brightness) and exp_auto_average_min (Min
Brightness)

   The auto-exposure tries to set the exposure time and gain factor
   such that the average intensity (i.e. brightness) in the image or
   exposure region is between a maximum and a minimum. The maximum
   brightness will be used if there is no saturation, e.g. no over-
   exposure due to bright surfaces or reflections. In case of
   saturation, the exposure time and gain factor are reduced, but only
   down to the minimum brightness.

   The maximum brightness has precedence over the minimum brightness
   parameter. If the minimum brightness is larger than the maximum
   brightness, the auto-exposure always tries to make the average
   intensity equal to the maximum brightness.

   The current brightness is always shown in the status bar below the
   images.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?<exp_auto_average_max|exp_auto_average_min>=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?<exp_auto_average_max|exp_auto_average_min>=<value>

exp_offset_x, exp_offset_y, exp_width, exp_height (Exposure Region)

   These values define a rectangular region in the left rectified
   image for limiting the area used for computing the auto exposure.
   The exposure time and gain factor of both images are chosen to
   optimally expose the defined region. This can lead to over- or
   underexposure of image parts outside the defined region. If either
   the width or height is 0, then the whole left and right images are
   considered by the auto exposure function. This is the default.

   The region is visualized in the Web GUI by a rectangle in the left
   rectified image. It can be defined using the sliders or by
   selecting it in the image after pressing the button "Select Region
   in Image".

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?<exp_offset_x|exp_offset_y|exp_width|exp_height>=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?<exp_offset_x|exp_offset_y|exp_width|exp_height>=<value>

exp_value (Exposure)

      This value is the exposure time in manual exposure mode in
      seconds. This exposure time is kept constant even if the images
      are underexposed.

      Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_value=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?exp_value=<value>

gain_value (Gain (dB))

   This value is the gain factor in decibel that can be set in manual
   exposure mode. Higher gain factors reduce the required exposure
   time but introduce noise.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?gain_value=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?gain_value=<value>

brightness (Brightness)

   Adjusting the brightness lightens or darkens the entire image.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?brightness=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?brightness=<value>

wb_auto (White Balance Auto or Manual, only available for color
cameras)

   This value can be set to *true* for automatic white balancing or
   *false* for manually setting the ratio between the colors using
   "wb_ratio_red" and "wb_ratio_blue". The last automatically
   determined ratios are set into "wb_ratio_red" and "wb_ratio_blue"
   when switching automatic white balancing off. White balancing is
   without function for monochrome cameras and will not be displayed
   in the Web GUI in this case.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

   API version 2

      PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/<0,1,2,3>/nodes/rc_camera/parameters?wb_auto=<value>

   API version 1 (deprecated)

wb_ratio_blue, wb_ratio_red and wb_ratio_green (Blue Ratio, Red Ratio
and Green Ratio, only available for color cameras)

These values are used to set blue, red and green ratios for manual
white balance. White balancing is without function for monochrome
cameras and will not be displayed in the Web GUI in this case.

Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

light_source_preset (Light Source Preset, only available for color
cameras)

   The light source preset parameter allows to correct color shifts
   caused by certain light sources. Depending on its specific color
   temperature, the light used for image acquisition can cause color
   shifts in the image. These color shifts can be corrected by
   selecting the related light source preset. Possible values are
   *Off*, *Tungsten*, *Daylight5000K*, *Daylight6500K* and
   *FactoryLED6000K*.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.

saturation (Saturation, only available for color cameras)

   Adjusting the saturation changes the colorfulness (intensity) of
   the colors. A higher saturation, e.g., makes colors easier to
   distinguish.

   Via the REST-API, this parameter can be set as follows.
