Measurement principles

The

rc_visard NG

 is a self-registering 3D camera. It provides rectified camera,
disparity, confidence, and error images, which enable the viewed
scene's depth values along with their uncertainties to be computed.
Furthermore, the motion of visual features in the images is combined
with acceleration and turn-rate measurements at a high rate, which
enables the sensor to provide real-time estimates of its current pose,
velocity, and acceleration.

In the following, the underlying measurement principles are explained
in more detail.
