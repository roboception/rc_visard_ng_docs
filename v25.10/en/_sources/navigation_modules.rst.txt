Navigation modules

The

rc_visard NG

's navigation modules contain:

Sensor dynamics (rc_dynamics, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics})
provides estimates of rc_visard's dynamic state such as its pose,
velocity, and acceleration. These states are transmitted as continuous
data streams via the rc_dynamics interface. For this purpose, the
dynamics module manages and fuses data from the following individual
subcomponents:  Visual odometry (rc_stereovisodo, Section
\ref{stereo_visodo:sect-visual-odometry})  estimates the motion of the
rc_visard device based on the motion of characteristic visual features
in the left camera images.  Stereo INS (rc_stereo_ins, Section
\ref{stereo_ins:sect-stereo-ins})  combines visual odometry
measurements with readings from the on-board Inertial Measurement Unit
(IMU) to provide accurate and high-frequency state estimates in real
time.  SLAM (rc_slam, Section \ref{slam:sect-slam})  performs
simultaneous localization and mapping for correcting accumulated
poses. The rc_visard's covered trajectory is offered via the REST-API
interface\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}).
