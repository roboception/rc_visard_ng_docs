Camera pipelines
================

The |rc_xxx| supports multiple cameras at the same time. For this, it offers up to four
*camera pipelines* that can be configured by the user.

A camera pipeline contains several software modules which are responsible for
acquiring data of the camera connected to that pipeline, performing detections or 
configuring modules used in this pipeline, e.g. by hand-eye calibration.

.. only:: rc_cube and (roboception or schunk)

   The |rc_xxx| supports cameras of type |rc_visard|, |rc_viscore|, |zivid|, |orbbec|, |stereo_ace| and |blaze|. 
   The type of the corresponding camera pipeline has to be configured to match
   the connected device.

.. only:: rc_reason_stack and (roboception or schunk)

   The |rc_xxx| supports cameras of type |rc_visard|, |rc_viscore|, |zivid|, |orbbec| and |stereo_ace|. 
   The type of the corresponding camera pipeline has to be configured to match
   the connected device.

.. only:: basler

   The |rc_xxx| supports cameras of type |rc_visard|, |stereo_ace| and |blaze|. 
   The type of the corresponding camera pipeline has to be configured to match
   the connected device.

.. only:: matrixvision

   The |rc_xxx| supports cameras of type |rc_visard|, |rc_viscore| and |orbbec|. 
   The type of the corresponding camera pipeline has to be configured to match
   the connected device.

Configuration of camera pipelines
---------------------------------

The camera pipelines can be configured via the :doc:`webgui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
under :menuselection:`System --> Camera Pipelines`. This page shows the running pipelines with their
types and the connected devices.

   Example of the *Camera Pipelines* page on an |rc_xxx| with two running pipelines of type ``rc_visard``

Clicking on :guilabel:`Configure Camera Pipelines` allows to configure the number and type of running pipelines
as shown in the next figure.

.. only:: rc_cube

   .. note:: The *rc_cube I* provides four camera pipelines, the *rc_cube S* two.

   Configuring the camera pipelines

The type of a running pipeline can be changed by selecting a different type in the drop down field.
A running pipeline can be removed by clicking :guilabel:`Remove Pipeline`. Only pipeline 0 can never be removed, because
this is the primary pipeline.
Clicking on :guilabel:`+ Add Pipeline` allows to choose the type for the new pipeline and creates a 
new pipeline of the chosen type.

.. only:: rc_cube

   Once the pipelines are configured as desired, clicking :guilabel:`Apply Changes & Reboot` will apply the new configuration
   and immediately reboot the |rc_cube|.

.. only:: rc_reason_stack

   Once the pipelines are configured as desired, clicking :guilabel:`Apply Changes` will apply the new configuration. Then, 
   the |rc_reason_stack| has to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Configuration of connected cameras
----------------------------------

A pipeline of a certain type can only discover devices of the same type. That means, a pipeline of type ``rc_visard`` can only
connect to an |rcvisard|. In case multiple cameras of the same type are connected to the |rc_xxx|, the user can set a *device
filter* to choose a specific camera for each pipeline. The current device filter value is displayed for each running pipeline
as shown in :numref:`fig-pipelines-running`. By default, the device filter is set to ``*``, which means that any device
matching the pipeline type will automatically be connected, but only if there is a unique match. Otherwise, no camera will be 
connected to that pipeline and an error will be shown. 

To adjust the device filter and select the camera to be connected to a pipeline, 
click on :guilabel:`Configure Camera Connection` on the *Camera Pipelines* page,
or select the corresponding pipeline in the menu, e.g. under :menuselection:`System --> Camera Pipelines --> Pipeline 1`.
This will show the current device filter value and more information about the connected
camera.

   Configuring the camera connection of pipeline 0

Clicking :guilabel:`Choose Camera` opens a dialog to edit the device filter.

   Choosing the camera by setting a device filter

This dialog also shows a list of all discovered devices matching the pipeline
type and highlights the ones that match the current value entered for the device filter. 
It also indicates if the devices are already in use in a different pipeline.
Device filters can be selected by clicking on an *Interface*, *Name* or *Serial*
of the desired device in the list. The following table shows possible device filter values.

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|
.. _tab-device-filters:
.. csv-table:: Possible device filter values
    :header:  Device filter, Description

    "\*",    "selects any device matching the pipeline type"
    "sensor<n>:*",   "selects any device connected via the sensor<n> interface that matches the pipeline type"
    "<name>",   "selects the device by the user-defined name"
    "<serial>",    "selects the device by the full serial number"
    "sensor<n>:<serial>",   "selects the device connected via the sensor<n> interface with the given serial"
    "sensor<n>:<name>",   "selects the device connected via the sensor<n> interface with the given user-defined name"
    "",    "if empty, no camera will be connected"
    
By pressing :guilabel:`Save`, the entered device filter is applied and a camera matching the device filter is connected to
this pipeline, if possible. Changing the device filter does not require a restart of the |rc_xxx|.
