Web GUI
=======

.. index:: ! Web GUI

The |rc_xxx|'s |webgui| can be used to test, calibrate, and configure the device.

Accessing the Web GUI
---------------------

The |webgui| can be accessed from any web browser, such as Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge, via
the |rc_xxx|'s IP address. The easiest way to access the |webgui| is to simply double click on the
desired device using the ``rcdiscover-gui`` tool as explained in :ref:`sect-discovery-of-rcvisard-devices`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-discovery-of-rcvisard-devices})`.

Alternatively, some network environments automatically configure the unique host name of
the |rc_xxx| in their Domain Name Server (:term:`DNS`). In this case, the |webgui| can also be
accessed directly using the :term:`URL` ``http://<host-name>`` by
replacing ``<host-name>`` with the device's host name.

For Linux and Mac operating systems, this even works without DNS via the multicast
Domain Name System (:term:`mDNS`), which is automatically used if ``.local`` is appended to the
host name. Thus, the URL simply becomes ``http://<host-name>.local``.

    Access to the |rc_visard| |webgui|
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    For troubleshooting, users can
    also directly access the |webgui| of the |rc_visard| device that
    is connected to the |rc_xxx|.
    It is available for the |rc_visard| on camera pipeline 0
    at port ``2342`` of the |rc_xxx|, and hence at
    the :term:`URL` ``http://<host>:2342``
    where ``<host>`` is the IP address or host
    name of the |rc_xxx| that the |rc_visard| is connected to.
    For camera pipelines 1, 2 or 3 it can be accessed at ``http://<host>:2343``,
    ``http://<host>:2344``, and ``http://<host>:2345``, respectively.

    By this means, users have access to the |rc_visard|'s device information
    or log files.

    .. note:: If a computer screen is directly connected to the |rc_xxx|,
              it shows the |webgui| with a small additional menu from which
              the |rc_visard|'s |webgui| can be accessed as well.


Exploring the Web GUI
---------------------

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

  The |webgui|'s dashboard page gives the most important information about the device
  and the software modules.

.. only:: rc_cube

  The |webgui|'s dashboard page gives the most important information about the device
  and the running camera pipelines.

.. figure:: images/webgui_dashboard.png
    :align: center

    Dashboard page of the |rc_xxx|'s |webgui|

The page's side menu permits access to the individual pages of the |rc_xxx|'s |webgui|:

.. only:: rc_cube

  *Pipeline*
    gives access to the respective camera pipeline and its camera, detection and configuration modules.
    Each camera pipeline provides an overview page with the most important information about the
    camera connection and the software modules running in the pipeline.

  .. figure:: images/webgui_pipeline_overview.png
      :align: center

      Pipeline overview page of the |rc_xxx|'s |webgui|

  Each pipeline provides a sub-menu with the individual pages for the modules running in the pipeline:

*Camera*
  shows a live stream of the rectified camera images.
  The frame rate can be reduced to save bandwidth when streaming to a
  GigE Vision\ |reg| client. Furthermore, exposure can be set manually or automatically.
  See :ref:`sect-camera`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{camera:sect-camera})` for more information.

.. only:: rc_cube

    *Depth Image*
      shows a live stream of the left rectified, disparity, and
      confidence images. The page contains various settings for depth-image
      computation and filtering. See :ref:`sect-3d-camera-modules`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{camera_modules:sect-3d-camera-modules})` for more information.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    *Depth Image*
      shows a live stream of the left rectified, disparity, and
      confidence images. The page contains various settings for depth-image
      computation and filtering. See :ref:`sect-stereo-matching`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching})` for more information.
      
.. only:: rc_visard

    *Dynamics*
      shows the location and movement of image features that are
      used to compute the |rcvisard|'s egomotion. Settings include the number of corners
      and features that should be used. See :ref:`sect-vo-parameters`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-vo-parameters})` for more information.

*Modules*
  gives access to the detection modules of the |rcxxx|
  (see :doc:`detection_modules`:latex:`, Section \ref{detection_modules:sect-detection-modules}`).

*Configuration*
  gives access to the configuration modules of the |rcxxx|
  (see :doc:`configuration_modules`:latex:`, Section \ref{configuration_modules:sect-configuration-modules}`).

.. only:: rc_cube

  The following modules running outside the pipelines can be accessed in the side menu:

*Database*
  gives access to the database modules of the |rcxxx|
  (see :doc:`database_modules`:latex:`, Section \ref{database_modules:sect-database-modules}`).

*System*
  gives access to general settings, device information and to the log files,
  and permits the firmware or the license file to be updated.

.. only:: rc_cube

  *UserSpace*
    gives access to the |rc_cube|'s UserSpace
    (see :doc:`userspace`:latex:`, Section \ref{userspace:sect-userspace}`).

.. Note:: Further information on all parameters in the |webgui| can be obtained by pressing the *Info*
          button next to each parameter.

.. _sect-webgui-ui-lock:

Web GUI access control
----------------------

The |webgui| has a simple mechanism to lock the UI against casual and accidental changes.

When enabling |webgui| access control via the *System* page, you will be asked to set a password.
Now the |webgui| is in a locked mode indicated by the lock symbol in the top bar.
All pages, camera streams, parameters and detections can be inspected as usual, but changes are not possible.

To temporarily unlock the |webgui| and make changes, click the lock symbol and enter the password.
While enabling or disabling |webgui| access control affects anyone accessing this |rc_xxx|,
the unlocked state is only valid for the browser where it was unlocked and indicated by the open lock symbol.
It is automatically locked again after 10 minutes of inactivity.

|webgui| access control can also be disabled again on the *System* page after providing the current password.

.. Warning:: This is not a security feature! It only locks the |webgui| and not the |rest-api|.
             It is meant to prevent accidental and casual changes e.g. via a connected screen.

.. Note:: In case the password is lost, this can be disabled via the |rest-api|
          :ref:`delete ui_lock<sect-rest-delete-system-ui-lock>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api_syslogs:sect-rest-delete-system-ui-lock})`.

.. _sect-webgui-camera-snapshot:

Downloading camera images
-------------------------

The |webgui|
provides an easy way to download a snapshot of the current scene as a .tar.gz file
by clicking on the camera icon below the image live streams on the *Camera* page. This snapshot contains:

-  the rectified camera images in full resolution as .png files,
-  a camera parameter file containing the camera matrix, image dimensions, exposure time,
   gain value and the stereo baseline,
-  the current IMU readings as imu.csv file, :cubeonly:`if available,`
-  a pipeline_status.json file containing information about all :cubeonly:`modules running inside the pipelines`:visardsonly:`3D-camera, detection and configuration nodes running` on the |rc_xxx|,
-  a backup.json file containing the settings of the |rc_xxx| including grippers, load carriers and regions of interest,
-  a system_info.json file containing system information about the |rc_xxx|.


The filenames contain the timestamps.

.. _sect-webgui-depth-snapshot:

Downloading depth images and point clouds
-----------------------------------------

The |webgui| provides an easy way to download the depth data of the current scene as a .tar.gz file
by clicking on the camera icon below the image live streams on the *Depth Image* page. This snapshot contains:

-  the rectified left and right camera images in full resolution as .png files,
-  an image parameter file corresponding to the left image containing the camera matrix, image dimensions, exposure time,
   gain value and the stereo baseline,
-  the disparity, error and confidence images in the resolution corresponding to the currently chosen quality as .png files,
-  a disparity parameter file corresponding to the disparity image containing the camera matrix, image dimensions, exposure time,
   gain value and the stereo baseline, and information about the disparity values (i.e. invalid values, scale, offset),
-  the current IMU readings as imu.csv file, :cubeonly:`if available,`
-  a pipeline_status.json file containing information about all :cubeonly:`modules running inside the pipelines`:visardsonly:`3D-camera, detection and configuration nodes running` on the |rc_xxx|,
-  a backup.json file containing the settings of the |rc_xxx| including grippers, load carriers and regions of interest,
-  a system_info.json file containing system information about the |rc_xxx|.

The filenames contain the timestamps.

When clicking on the mesh icon below the image live streams on the *Depth Image* page, a snapshot is downloaded
which additionally includes a mesh of the point cloud in the current depth quality (resolution) as .ply file.

.. note::
   Downloading a depth snapshot will trigger an acquisition in the same way as clicking on the "Acquire" button on the
   *Depth Image* page of the Web GUI, and, thus, might affect running applications.
