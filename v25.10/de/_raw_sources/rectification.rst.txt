To simplify image processing, the camera module rectifies all camera images
based on the camera calibration. This means that lens distortion is removed and
the principal point is located exactly in the middle of the image.

The model of a rectified camera is described with just one value, which is the focal length.
The |rc_xxx| reports a focal length factor via its various interfaces. It
relates to the image width for supporting different image resolutions. The
focal length :math:`f` in pixels can be easily obtained by multiplying the
focal length factor by the image width in pixels.

In case of a stereo camera, rectification also aligns images such that an
object point is always projected onto the same image row in both images.
The cameras' optical axes become exactly parallel.

.. This means that points at infinite distance are projected onto the same image column in both images.
.. The closer an object point is, the larger is the difference between its image
.. columns in the right and left images. This difference is called disparity.

   .. note:: If a |rgbd_only| camera is used instead of a stereo camera, only
             one camera image is provided. However, the image is rectified,
             i.e. lens distortion is removed and the principal point is in the
             image center.
