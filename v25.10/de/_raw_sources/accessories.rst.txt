   |company| offers an optional connectivity kit to aid customers with setting up the |rc_xxx|. 
   For permanent installation, the customer is responsible for providing a suitable power supply.
   The connectivity kit consists of a:

   - network cable with straight M12 plug to straight RJ45 connector in either 2 m, 5 m, or 10 m length,
   - power adapter cable with straight M12 socket to DC barrel connector in 30 cm length,
   - 24 V, 30 W wall power supply, or a 24 V, 60 W desktop power supply.

   Connecting the |rc_xxx| to residential or office grid power requires a power supply that 
   meets EN 55011 Class B emission standards. The E2CFS 30W 24V by EGSTON System Electronics 
   Eggenburg GmbH (http://www.egston.com) contained in the connectivity kit is certified 
   accordingly. However, it does not meet immunity standards for industrial environments 
   under EN 61000-6-2.

   To set up and operate an |rc_xxx| camera, certain cables and a power supply are necessary. 
   |company| offers these accessories that have been specifically tested for use with |company| cameras to ensure optimum performance. 
   Other makes are available (see :ref:`sect-accessories-wiring`).

   If the camera is to be installed in industrial environments where exposure to strong ESD sources may occur 
   (e.g., from frequency converters, contactors, large electric motors, or arc discharges) or where EN 61000-6-2 is required, 
   the customer must use a DIN rail power supply that satisfies EN 61000-6-2 in terms of immunity, increased temperature range, 
   and secure connectors.

Wiring
------

Cables are by default not provided with the |rc_xxx|. It is the customer's responsibility 
to obtain appropriate parts. The following sections provide an overview of suggested components.

Ethernet connections
""""""""""""""""""""
.. index::
   single: network cable

The |rc_xxx| provides an industrial 8-pin A-coded M12 socket connector for Ethernet connectivity. 
Various cabling solutions can be obtained directly from third party vendors.

**CAT5 (1 Gbps) M12 plug to RJ45**

- Straight M12 plug to straight RJ45 connector, 10 m length: Phoenix Contact NBC-MS/ 10,0-94B/R4AC SCO, Art.-Nr.: 1407417
- Straight M12 plug to straight RJ45 connector, 10 m length: MURR Electronics Art.-Nr.: 7700-48521-S4W1000

Power connections
"""""""""""""""""

.. index::
   single: power cable

An 8-pin A-coded M12 plug connector is provided for power and GPIO connectivity. 
Various cabling solutions can be obtained from third party vendors. A selection of M12 
to open ended cables is provided below. Customers are required to provide power and GPIO 
connections to the cables according to the pinouts described in 
:ref:`sect-wiring`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-wiring})`. 
The |rc_xxx|'s housing must be connected to ground.

**Sensor/Actor cable M12 socket to open end**

Power supplies
""""""""""""""

.. index::
   single: power supply

The |rc_xxx| is classified as an EN-55011 Class B device and immune to light 
industrial and industrial environments. For connecting the sensor to residential 
grid power, a power supply under EN 55011/55022 Class B has to be used.

It is the customer's responsibility to obtain and install a suitable power supply 
satisfying EN 61000-6-2 for permanent installation in industrial environments. One 
example that satisfies both EN 61000-6-2 and EN 55011/55022 Class B is the DIN-Rail
mounted PULS MiniLine ML60.241 24V/DC 2.5 A by PULS GmbH (http://www.pulspower.com). 
A certified electrician must perform installation.

Only one |rc_xxx| shall be connected to a power supply at any time, and the total 
length of cables must be less than 30 m.
