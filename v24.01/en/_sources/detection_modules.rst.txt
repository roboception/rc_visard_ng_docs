Detection modules

The

rc_visard NG

 offers software modules for different detection applications:

LoadCarrier (rc_load_carrier, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-
loadcarrier})  allows detecting load carriers and their filling
levels.

TagDetect (rc_april_tag_detect and rc_qr_code_detect, Section
\ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection})  allows the detection of AprilTags
and QR codes, as well as the estimation of their poses.

ItemPick and BoxPick (rc_itempick and rc_boxpick, Section
\ref{itempick:sect-itempick})  provides an out-of-the-box perception
solution for robotic pick-and-place applications of unknown objects or
boxes.

SilhouetteMatch (rc_silhouettematch, Section \ref{silhouettematch
:sect-silhouettematch})  provides an object detection solution for
objects placed on a plane or stacked planar objects.

These modules are optional and can be activated by purchasing a
separate

license
