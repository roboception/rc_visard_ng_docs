    Hardware issues
    ---------------

    **LED does not illuminate**

    The |rc_xxx| does not start up.

    - Ensure that cables are connected and secured properly.
    - Ensure that adequate DC voltage (18 V to 30 V) with correct polarity is applied to the
      power connector at the pins labeled as **Power** and **Ground** as described in
      the device's :ref:`pin assignment specification<tab-power-pin-assignments>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:tab-power-pin-assignments})`.
      Connecting the sensor to voltage outside of the specified range, to alternating current,
      with reversed polarity, or to a supply with voltage spikes will lead to permanent hardware damage.

    .. only:: rc_visard
      
      **LED turns red while the sensor appears to function normally**

    .. only:: rc_visard_ng
      
      **LED turns yellow while the sensor appears to function normally**

    This may indicate a high housing temperature. The sensor might be mounted in a position that
    obstructs free airflow around the cooling fins.

    - Clean cooling fins and housing.
    - Ensure a minimum of 10 cm free space in all directions around cooling fins to provide adequate convective cooling.
    - Ensure that ambient temperature is within specified range.

    The sensor may slow down processing when cooling is insufficient or the ambient temperature exceeds the specified range.

    **Reliability issues and/or mechanical damage**

    This may be an indication of ambient conditions (vibration, shock, resonance, and temperature) being outside
    of specified range. Please refer to the :ref:`specification of environmental conditions<tab-hardware-environment>`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{hardware_spec:tab-hardware-environment})`.

    - Operating the |rc_xxx| outside of specified ambient conditions might lead to damage and will void the warranty.

    **Electrical shock when touching the sensor**

    This indicates an electrical fault in sensor, cabling, or power supply or adjacent system.

    - Immediately turn off power to the system, disconnect cables, and have a qualified electrician check the setup.
    - Ensure that the sensor housing is properly grounded; check for large ground loops.


    Connectivity issues
    -------------------

    **LED briefly flashes red every 5 seconds**

    If the LED briefly flashes red every 5 seconds, then the |rc_xxx| is not able to detect a network
    link.

    - Check that the network cable is properly connected to the |rc_xxx| and the network.
    - If no problem is visible, then replace the Ethernet cable.

    **A GigE Vision client or rcdiscover-gui cannot detect the camera**

    - Check whether the |rc_xxx|'s LED flashes briefly every 5 seconds (check the cable if it does).
    - Ensure that the |rc_xxx| is connected to the same subnet (the discovery mechanism uses broadcasts that
      will not work across different subnets).

    **The Web GUI is inaccessible**

    - Ensure that the |rc_xxx| is turned on and connected to the same subnet as the host computer.
    - Check whether the |rc_xxx|'s LED flashes briefly every 5 seconds (check the cable if it does).
    - Check whether ``rcdiscover-gui`` detects the sensor. If it reports the |rc_xxx| as unreachable,
      then the |rc_xxx|'s
      :ref:`network configuration<sect-network-configuration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-network-configuration})` is wrong.
    - If the |rc_xxx| is reported as reachable, try double clicking the entry to open the |webgui| in a browser.
    - If this does not work, try entering the |rc_xxx|'s reported IP address directly in the browser
      as target address.

    **Too many Web GUIs are open at the same time**

    The |webgui| consumes the |rc_xxx|'s processing resources to compress images to be transmitted
    and for statistical output that is regularly polled by the browser. Leaving several instances of
    the |webgui| open on the same or different computers can significantly diminish the |rc_xxx|'s
    performance. The |webgui| is meant for configuration and validation, not to permanently monitor
    the |rc_xxx|.

.. _sect-camera-issues:

Camera-image issues
-------------------

**The camera image is too bright**

- If the camera is in manual exposure mode, decrease the exposure time (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`), or
- switch to auto-exposure mode (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`).

**The camera image is too dark**

- If the camera is in manual exposure mode, increase the exposure time (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`), or
- switch to auto-exposure mode (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`).

**The camera image is too noisy**

Large gain factors cause high-amplitude image noise. To decrease the image noise,

- use an additional light source to increase the scene's light intensity, or
- choose a greater maximal auto-exposure time (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`).

**The camera image is out of focus**

- Check whether the object is too close to the lens and increase the distance between the object and the lens if it is.
- Check whether the camera lenses are dirty and clean them if they are.
- If none of the above applies, a severe hardware problem might exist.
  Please :ref:`contact support<sect-contact>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{contact:sect-contact})`.

**The camera image is blurred**

Fast motions in combination with long exposure times can cause blur. To reduce motion blur,

- decrease the motion speed of the camera,
- decrease the motion speed of objects in the field of view of the camera, or
- decrease the exposure time of the camera (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`).

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    **The camera image is fuzzy**

    - Check whether the lenses are dirty and clean them if so (see :ref:`sect-lens-cleaning`:latex:`, Section \ref{maintenance:sect-lens-cleaning}`).
    - If none of the above applies, a severe hardware problem might exist.
      Please :ref:`contact support<sect-contact>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{contact:sect-contact})`.

**The camera image frame rate is too low**

- Increase the image frame rate as described in :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params})`.
- The maximal frame rate of the cameras is 25 Hz.

.. _sect-disparity-issues:

Depth/Disparity, error, and confidence image issues
---------------------------------------------------
All these guidelines also apply to error and confidence images, because they correspond directly to the disparity image.

**The disparity image is too sparse or empty**

- Check whether the camera images are well exposed and sharp. Follow the instructions in
  :ref:`sect-camera-issues`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{troubleshooting:sect-camera-issues})` if applicable.
- Check whether the scene has enough texture (see :ref:`sect-stereo-matching`:latex:`, Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`) and install an external pattern projector if required.
- Decrease the :ref:`Minimum Distance
  <expl-depth-min-depth>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Increase the :ref:`Maximum Distance <expl-depth-max-depth>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Check whether the object is too close to the cameras. Consider the different depth ranges of the camera variants.
- Decrease the :ref:`Minimum Confidence <expl-depth-min-conf>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Increase the :ref:`Maximum Depth Error <expl-depth-max-depth-err>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Choose a lesser :ref:`Disparity Image Quality <expl-depth-quality>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`. Lower resolution disparity images are generally less sparse.

.. only:: rc_visard or rc_visard_ng

    - Check the cameras' calibration and recalibrate if required (see :ref:`sect-camera-calibration`:latex:`, Section
      \ref{camera_calibration:sect-camera-calibration}`).

**The disparity images' frame rate is too low**

- Check and increase the frame rate of the camera images (see :ref:`sect-cam-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`).
  The frame rate of the disparity image cannot be greater than the frame rate of the camera images.
- Choose a lesser :ref:`Disparity Image Quality <expl-depth-quality>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Increase the :ref:`Minimum Distance
  <expl-depth-min-depth>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`
  as much as possible for the application.

**The disparity image does not show close objects**

- Check whether the object is too close to the cameras. Consider the depth ranges of the camera variants.
- Decrease the :ref:`Minimum Distance <expl-depth-min-depth>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.

**The disparity image does not show distant objects**

- Increase the :ref:`Maximum Distance <expl-depth-max-depth>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Increase the :ref:`Maximum Depth Error <expl-depth-max-depth-err>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Decrease the :ref:`Minimum Confidence <expl-depth-min-conf>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.

**The disparity image is too noisy**

- Increase the :ref:`Segmentation value <expl-depth-seg>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Increase the :ref:`Fill-In value <expl-depth-fill>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.

**The disparity values or the resulting depth values are too inaccurate**

- Decrease the distance between the camera and the scene. Depth-measurement error grows quadratically with the distance from the cameras.
- Check whether the scene contains repetitive patterns and remove them if it does. They could cause wrong disparity measurements.

**The disparity image is too smooth**

- Decrease the :ref:`Fill-In value <expl-depth-fill>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.

**The disparity image does not show small structures**

- Decrease the :ref:`Segmentation value <expl-depth-seg>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.
- Decrease the :ref:`Fill-In value <expl-depth-fill>`:latex:`\:(Section
  \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`.

    .. _sect-pose-issues:

    Dynamics issues
    ---------------

    **State estimates are unavailable**

    - Check in the |webgui| that pose estimation has been switched on
      (see :ref:`sect-vo-parameters`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-vo-parameters}`).
    - Check in the |webgui| that the update rate is about |imu-rate|.
    - Check the *Logs* in the |webgui| for errors.

    **The state estimates are too noisy**

    - Adapt the parameters for visual odometry as described in :ref:`sect-vo-parameters`:latex:`\:(Section
      \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-vo-parameters})`.
    - Check whether the *camera pose stream* has enough accuracy.

    **Pose estimation has jumps**

    - Has the SLAM module been turned on? SLAM can cause jumps when reducing errors due to a
      loop closure.
    - Adapt the parameters for visual odometry as described in :ref:`sect-vo-parameters`:latex:`\:(Section
      \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-vo-parameters})`.

    **Pose frequency is too low**

    - Use the real-time pose stream with a |imu-rate| update rate. See
      :ref:`sect-stereo-ins`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_ins:sect-stereo-ins})`.

    **Delay/Latency of pose is too great**

    - Use the real-time pose stream. See
      :ref:`sect-stereo-ins`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_ins:sect-stereo-ins})`.

GigE Vision/GenICam issues
--------------------------

**No images**

- Check that the modules are enabled. See ``ComponentSelector`` and ``ComponentEnable`` in
  :ref:`sect-genicam-params`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam-params})`.
