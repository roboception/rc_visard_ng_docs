3D camera modules

The

rc_visard NG

's 3D camera software consists of the following modules:

Camera (rc_camera, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera})
acquires image pairs and performs planar rectification for using the
camera as a measurement device. Images are provided both for further
internal processing by other modules and for external use as GenICam
image streams.

Stereo matching (rc_stereomatching, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
stereo-matching})  uses the rectified stereo image pairs to compute 3D
depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

The

Camera

 and the

Stereo matching

 modules, which acquire image pairs and compute 3D depth information
such as disparity, error, and confidence images, are also accessible
via the

rc_visard NG

's

GigE Vision/GenICam interface
